He arrived in his full uniform, and was overcome with emotion when he heard the congregation shout &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; after he uttered the Islamic declaration of faith.\nThe army veteran never thought that the words that had terrified him in Iraq would be the very same that would welcome him to his new faith. They are words that he now uses in prayer.\nContrary to what many people seem to think, the words &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; simply mean &#8220;God is greater.&#8221; It is a powerful declaration used by Muslims on many occasions and in many prayers. It is a celebration of life, the first words fathers whisper in the ears of their newborns. They are used to indicate gratitude when God bestows something upon you that you would have been incapable of attaining were it not for divine benevolence. It is a prayerful phrase that reminds us that, no matter what our concerns may be, God is greater than them.\nWorshipers at a mosque in Quebec reportedly heard the phrase &#8220;Allahu Akhbar,&#8221; the very phrase they recite in morning prayers, uttered by their white supremacist attacker just before he opened fire and killed six Muslims this January. And Muslims at a mosque in Minnesota were reciting &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; during their morning prayers when their mosque was firebombed this August.\nIs &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; sometimes used as a battle cry? Yes, though as Sen. John McCain has argued on Fox News, that does not make the phrase itself abhorrent. While noting that &#8220;moderate Muslims&#8221; also say &#8220;Allahu Akbar,&#8221; McCain said the phrase is no more troubling that a Christian saying &#8220;Thank God.&#8221;\nBut the way &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; often appears in the media seems to serve a nefarious agenda: to instill fear of anyone who utters the phrase and to raise concerns even about Islam itself. But a lone terrorist who shouts &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; while murdering innocent people in the streets of New York does not get to own that term. Nor do those who declare that no further details are needed to determine motive once a man with a Muslim-sounding name perpetrates an attack using those words.\nAs Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR-Florida, said in response to the recent terror attack in New York, &#8220;That is the biggest act of heresy to shout God&#8217;s glorious name when committing the worst crime against God.&#8221;\nThough these words that are used to celebrate life also sometimes accompany horrific acts, this is not a new phenomenon.\nOf the greatest ironies noted by the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), was the birth and death of Abdullah Ibn Az Zubayr.\nAbdullah Ibn Az Zubayr was the first child born in the Muslim community after they had migrated to Medina from Mecca to escape persecution.\nSome residents of Medina told Muslims that they had placed a spell on them that would prevent them from having children. When Abdullah was born, his grandfather Abu Bakr carried him through the streets as the crowd happily chanted &#8220;Allahu Akbar.&#8221;\nWhen Abdullah was murdered by another group of Muslims as he stood for justice in Mecca, his murderers also chanted &#8220;Allahu Akbar.&#8221;\nAs one witness said, &#8220;I was there the day Abdullah was born, and I am here the day he has died, and I heard those who said Allahu Akbar the day he was born and I heard those who have said Allahu Akbar the day he has died, and I swear by Allah those who said Allahu Akbar the day when he was born were far greater than those who have said Allahu Akbar today!&#8221;\nWhile those who killed Abdullah used the same words as those who celebrated his birth, only one group truly honored the greatness of God. They are the ones who get to own the term: those who live in a way that celebrates the greatness of God by obeying his commands and serving his creation, not those who flout those commands and attack his creation unjustly.\nWe mustn&#8217;t allow terrorists or agendas of fear to own any of the words, concepts, or devotions found in the sacred text of a quarter of the world&#8217;s population. That would give them exactly what they want. And God is far greater than the ugliness committed in His name. &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8230;&#8221;\nRead more:\nIs Islam a Death Cult?

So itâs better for women not to memorize because they wonât be able to retain it while raising children.â I couldnât hide my shock and immediately responded that I knew many men who had memorized the Quran and, for some reason or another, had not retained it. But the encounter stayed with me: how could he have discouraged women from simultaneously pursuing two of the greatest deedsâmemorizing the Quran and raising children? In that moment, he took something that had given me inspiration, strength, and serenityâthe endless hours and dedication put into memorizing the Quranâand left me feeling disempowered.\nWe cannot deny that Muslim communities have a problem with gender. On the one hand, Muslims feel frustrated by the injustices they seeâboth major and minorâwhen it comes toÂ gender. On the other hand, many Muslim men (and some women) feel exasperated by what they see as a growing segment within the MuslimÂ feministÂ movement that condemns all men as sexist and all institutions, including religion, as inherently misogynistic. Â \nWhat is Feminism?\nDuring the late 19th century, the termÂ fÃ©minismeÂ surfaced in France and quickly spread to other European nations, eventually reaching the Americas by 1910.[1]Â The original French term reveals the roots of the concept:Â femme,Â meaningÂ &#8220;woman,&#8221; and &#8211;isme,Â meaningÂ a social or political ideology. Yet, from theÂ outset, the labelÂ feminismÂ was not readily adopted by most women due to disagreements over its meaning. Hence, from its inception, what it meant to be a feminist was in constant flux, changing as a function of culture and politics.[2]Â Some aspects of the ideology, nevertheless, have remained relatively consistent: feminism in general seeks to challenge expectations and disparities associated with gender.[3]Â In any case, segments of this movement have continued to develop, with some branches representing revolutionary changes in what âbeing a womanâ means. At times it has involved a call for equal career opportunities for women; at others, it has involved rejection of prevailing attitudes towards gender rooted in religious paradigms.[4]\nIn the United States, in particular, the history of mainstream white feminism is often described in waves. First-wave feminism involved the movement for womenâs suffrage; it was introduced at the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 by prominent figures Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. This wave emerged in the context of industrialization and focused on equal employment opportunities for women. In the 1960s and 1970s, the second wave of feminism was closely tied to both the post-war and civil rights movements. Finally, beginning in the 1990s, feminism enteredÂ its third wave, which, like so many other movements, deals with the questions ofÂ post-colonialism.[5]Â Of course, throughout history, women across the world have always struggled for themselves and their families, whether they have been labeled âfeministsâ or not.\nFeminism has naturally continued to evolve. Today, many different movements, causes, and groups claim ownership of the term and its values, and it has become, like other social justice ideas,Â intersectionalÂ in its application. Now, self-identifying feminists have their own understanding of the term that is informed by their experiences. Some feminists speak out against sexual assault and unfair wages; others critique the movement as a whole for its whiteness and class privilege, while reclaiming their unique space in it. What has been primarily identified as a movement about gender and equality has had to grapple with different conceptions of both of these terms, as well as their intersections with race, class, religion, citizenship, war, imperialism, and more.[6]Â Feminism, then, is defined by its history as much as it is by critiques of that history.\nCritics of the Muslim feminist movement, in particular, argue that the ideology leads its followers down a slippery slope that begins with concerns over gender-based oppression, goes on to attribute that oppression to religion, and ends with the abandonment of faith altogether due to the perception that religious institutions and doctrines are inherently patriarchal and misogynistic.[7]Â Much of this argument rests on the fact thatÂ some foundational aspects of the feminist project Â have been incompatible with religion in general, and may even be irreconcilable withÂ IslamÂ (e.g., the ascription of all gender differences to social determinants, or the wholesale rejection of any distinct gender roles). Thus, opponents of feminism argue that some who embrace this ideology may leave, or may be prone to leaving, the fold of Islam.Â In this piece, we describe the problem as we see it and assess the most effective ways forward that are rooted in our tradition.\nThe Problem\nSo why do some Muslim feminists leave Islam? Although there isnât only one answer to this question, a useful first step may involve asking a different question, âWhy do some Muslim women leave Muslim spaces?âÂ TheÂ 2014Â UnmosquedÂ studyÂ surveyed mosques across the country to assess the challenges associated with sustaining a successful Muslim community in the United States today.Â The main finding was that Muslim women are among the most impacted by these challenges. At that time, mosques reported a decade-long average female attendance ofÂ 18% at events like Friday prayer, compared to male attendance of 77%. Of course, while this may be partly due to the fact that attendance is obligatory for men and not for women, the data also suggest that, in general, mosques may not be the most welcoming places for women. While many mosques included womenâs programs, only 4% of them prioritized these programs and activities, and only 3% of mosques prioritized womenâs groups and associations.[8]Â We know that historically, by and large, womenâs representation in mosque leadership has been minimal, as has been the amplification of womenâs voices at events, lectures, and other platforms. The issue of physical space also looms large: many mosques do not have adequate womenâs spaces, and women often dealÂ with prayer areas that are cramped, unsanitary, and otherwiseÂ inaccessible.\nOutside of these houses of worship, Muslim women, like all women, face challenges at home and in society, includingÂ domestic violenceÂ and sexual harassment. In some cases, the perpetrators of these abuses use religion to justify and legitimize their actionsâa problem certainly not unique to Islam.\nAnd finally, Muslim women bear the brunt of what all Muslimsâespecially those who are visibly Muslimâface, which is increasing Islamophobia. AÂ 2017 ISPU studyÂ of American Muslims found that Muslim women are the most likely to suffer from hate crimes and explicit Islamophobia in the post-Trump era, and that they are the most likely to report it.[9]\nWhat this leaves us with, then, isÂ aÂ community in which there are very few spaces tailored for, and committed to, empowering Muslim women to reach their full potential and make meaningful contributions. To be sure, some Muslim women continue to exercise their own agency to excel, achieve, represent their faith, and lead in their communities, despite these challenges. But oftentimes, they turn to other spaces that take their concernsâincluding the lack of support, resources, and literal and figurative space they areÂ affordedÂ in their own communitiesâseriously, and place those concerns within the context of a broader feminist struggle against patriarchal systems.Â What is often attractive here is not necessarily the ideologyÂ itself but its goal of addressing some of the injustices faced by Muslim women, a goal that is not seen to be on the agenda in many Muslim spaces.Â \nSo What Should We Do?\nSome Muslims promote a brand of Islamic feminism thatÂ predicates its notion of womenâs liberation on the sociocultural norms of the West, taking these norms as universal truths by which theyÂ call into question the validity ofÂ gender-related teachingsÂ of the Quran and Sunna. They advocate for Muslims toÂ embrace everything labeled âfeminismâ andÂ jump wholeheartedly onÂ toÂ this ideological bandwagon in order to solve theÂ communityâsÂ challengesÂ associated with gender.Â Meanwhile, otherÂ MuslimsÂ see feminism as a foreign threat to the integrity of Islam, a poison that will gradually erode all core Islamic values by forcing Muslims to change religious traditions to adopt western liberal ideals and norms. Some of these people direct their efforts entirely towards the refutation of feminism, while neglecting the underlying issues which drive women towards the feminist camp to beginÂ with.\nIt is of course important to educate ourselvesÂ on the ideological roots ofÂ feminism and their potential contradictionsÂ with the faith, both at their originsÂ and when taken to their logicalÂ ends.Â This is part of encouraging ourselves to be mindful in our activism and self-reflective in our critiques. At the same time, to focus on feminism as the primary reason for women leaving the faith is problematic for at least two reasons: 1) it involves addressing what we see as a symptom of Muslim womenâs alienation and not its root causes; and 2) it risks further alienating those who already feel they have no space in the MuslimÂ community.Â \nWhat is more pressing is addressing the reasons some Muslim women and men are turning to secular feminism in the first place. Instead of acceptingÂ gender norms in our community that are not rooted in Islam,Â and as a result brushing aside all forms of sexism, small and large,Â we should focus on establishing an environment that empowers Muslim women and recognizes their centrality in the Islamic traditionâhistorically, currently, and in the future.Â Before delineating all the reasons feminism is not, and cannot, be compatible with Islam, we should redouble our efforts to understand theÂ IslamicÂ approach to gender, andÂ implement itÂ in our families, mosques, organizations, and communities.Â Instead of pointing the finger of blame at a feminist bogey(wo)man that is pulling Muslims away from their faith,Â weÂ should first hold ourselves accountable for failing toÂ behave in ways consistent withÂ propheticÂ teachings.\nWhat is the Prophetic Example?\nIronically, the Prophetic precedent,Â in spite of its beauty and perfection,Â is often abused to promote negative treatment of women. Quite often Friday sermons and evening lectures are interlaced with decontextualizedÂ hadithÂ that imply the inferiority of women and impede women from becoming full participants in their own communities.Â Take for example theÂ hadithÂ that ostensibly declares that women areÂ nÄqiá¹£Ät Ê¿aql wa-dÄ«n, or âdeficient in intellect and religion.â[10]Â It is easy to lose count of the number of times thisÂ hadithÂ has beenÂ usedÂ with a pointed finger to remind the audience that men are superior and more fit to lead in every situation. Yet, often missing is the specific context of this saying of the Prophet ï·º, which actually was not a sermon on the topic of gender, but was instead about charity.[11]Â He said it on Eid day as heÂ ï·ºÂ was preaching to the men and women after prayer. He turned to the men and called out to them to spend in charity for the sake of Allah (swt). He then turned to the women, and by way of encouragement, reminded them to increase in their charity as well, alluding to the fact that during their menstruation and the like, they were not responsible for prayer and fasting. Thus, by advising them to increase their donations, the ProphetÂ ï·ºÂ wasÂ pointing them to other opportunities for coming closer to Allah (swt). The intention behind his words was immediately understood by those who were there to actually witness them. Zaynab b. Abu Muawiyah immediately ran back to her home after the Eid prayer, rushing to adhere to the counsel of the ProphetÂ ï·ºÂ and give from her wealth in charity. This crucial context to theÂ hadithÂ illustrates that the Prophet ï·ºwas not making any kind of ontological declaration about the relative worth or capacity of women in relation to men, nor was he delineating some kind of cosmological hierarchy of gender with men occupying a rank above women;[12]Â rather, he ï·º was making an exhortation in that particular situation to women to take the lead in charity in light of their lessened responsibilities in other domains and their tremendous influence on men.\nNow imagine that your average imam or religious teacher led his congregation with the assumption that women are just as capable of being scholars and leaders in theirÂ communities. Imagine that your average mosque or organizational leadership not only held this assumption, but actively implemented it by constituting itself of both men and women and valuing the voices and concerns of all members equally. We are far from this reality.Â Calling out âthe patriarchyâ is often representative of the frustration of women who do not see their concerns taken seriously, and do not see themselves reflected as integral to their own communities. Waging war against feminism may unintentionally enable those in our communities who seek to discredit and silence women by labeling every complaint they raise as due to feminism.\nWhen the Prophet ï·º received complaints from female companions, he listened to them attentively and took them very seriously. Take, for instance, the story of Khawla bint Thaâlabah (ra) who complained of her husbandâs unjust actions towards her. The response to her complaint came from none other than God Himself, to be preserved in the Quran as an example until the end of time: âGod has heard the words of the woman who disputed with you [Prophet] about her husband and complained to God: God has heard what you both had to sayâ [Quran 58:1]. In this verse and those that follow, Allah (swt) sets the best of examples by not only acknowledging the concerns of Khawla (ra), but also legitimizing them and providing a solution through an entire chapter in the Quran named after her. Â \nThe reality of the matter is that Muslim women throughoutÂ historyÂ have been leaders in scholarship and luminaries in various fields. From Aishah (ra), the wife of the ProphetÂ ï·º, who corrected her male counterparts in matters ofÂ hadithÂ andÂ jurisprudence and Nusayba bint Kaab (ra) who fought alongside the ProphetÂ ï·ºÂ in battle, to Sutayta al-Mahamli who found solutions to some of the most complicated mathematical equations of her time and Queen Amina of Zaria who protected her kingdom, Muslim women have set unparalleled standards in serving their communities.Â Yet, despite this rich history, we have managed to erase our memories of their contributions and rewrite their stories to fall in line with our own expectations of women as marginal figures.Â It is up to us to revive these precedents and instill strength and motivation in our women, young and old, in order to empower the current generation and those to come to achieve their full potential in serving others and serving God.\nMoving Forward\nThereÂ may well be many ideas advanced under the label of âfeminismâ that pose a problem for Muslimsâand some that may even be antithetical to Islam. But the truth is that there are many secular ideologies that, when taken to their extremes, clearly contradict Islamic religious and moral creeds. The only way we can avoid the pitfalls of these ideologies is by looking beyond labels, evaluating the concepts themselves, and approaching them from a firm foundation in our tradition. If we are confident in Islam and its sources and methodology, we can face these dogmas head-on. Only then can we sort through complex theories to affirm what is good and discard that which does not align with our religion.\nWe must acknowledge, however, that not all Muslimsânot even mostâhave this firm foundation. For this reason, we need to focus our efforts on training imams and community leaders to provide spaces where those struggling with their religion can be critical and ask questions. We must create platforms for everyoneâbut especially for those who are marginalized, like women, youth, converts, and othersâto voice their doubts and misgivings about Islam without shutting down their very real concerns by accusing them of being brainwashed by Western ideologies. And where those concerns are a result of our own imperfections and shortcomings as human beings, and a failure to live up to the prophetic ideal, we need to recognize and address them. Until we do so, those who cannot fully express themselves in their own mosques and communities, will undoubtedly turn to outlets thatÂ willÂ provide them with the answers they are lookingÂ for.\n\n\n[1]Â Estelle Freedman,Â No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of WomenÂ (New York: The Random House Publishing Group, 2002), 18.\n\n\n[2]Â Ibid, 17.\n\n\n[3]Â Ibid, 20.\n\n\n[4]Â Mary Kassian,Â The Feminist MistakeÂ (Wheaton: Good News Publishers, 2005), 11.\n\n\n[5]Â Charlotte Krolokke and Anne Scott Sorensen, âThree Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls,âÂ inÂ Gender Communication Theories &amp; Analyses: From Silence to Performance,Â (Thousand Oaks:Â Sage Publications,Â 2006), pp. 1&#8211;25.\n\n\n[6]Â On intersectionality, see Kimberle Crenshaw, &#8220;Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics,&#8221;Â University of Chicago Legal ForumÂ 1989:1, 8.

Rather, it means lessened responsibility (takhfÄ«f al-taklÄ«f), as a woman does not pray or fast during her period. â (January 11, 2016, IslamToday.net,Â http://www.islamtoday.net/albasheer/artshow-12-221128.htm).\n\n\n[12]Â The Andalusian jurist, Ibn Hazm (d. 456 H) explained the fallacy of taking thisÂ hadithÂ as an ontological description by pointing out that any man who makes such a claim must assuredly admit to being inferior in intelligence and religion compared to the revered Islamic figures of Maryam, Aisha, Fatima, the mother of Moses, and Sarah. He explained that the Prophet ï·ºâs statement refers only to reduction in prayers and fasting, and the reduction in testimony and does not entail a criticism of women.

At one point, thousands of Yezidis had fled to a mountain and were under siege by Daesh.[1]Â According to the story, the American military heroically came to their rescue.[2]Â Then the story changed: there were far fewer on the mountain than previously believed, and most did not want to leave. I still donât know what really happened. Is there any way to know? What good would knowing do?[3]\nApparently (again, according to the story), local Iraqis call the Yezidi âdevil worshippers.â Someone told me they revere Iblis for having refused to bow to Adam when Allah commanded the angels to do so. The rationale, apparently, is that Iblis was a true monotheist who would bow to nobody but Allah. I know not whether this is really what Yezidis believe. It seems not, according to this source.[4]Â \nWhat is more interesting to me (and more productive to reflect on) is not whether Yezidis believe this (or what they believe), but the idea itself: that Iblisâ refusal to bow to Adam expresses not his rebellion against God, but the purity of his faith. The orthodox Muslim response to this (as I understand it) would be that it disregards the content of Godâs command. Submission to God is not simply the refusal to submit to anything other than Him. Submission is a positive act of obedience, and therefore requires a specific commandâa âdo thisâ, such that submission is made real when âthisâ is done. Walk around the Kaaba seven times, run seven times between the two hills, throw stones at the pillarsâ¦bow to Adam.\nIn this caseâthe first case of rebellion against Godâthe command was to bow to Adam. It sounds like a clever idea, that disobedience here is actually a purer form of submissionâthe kind of reasoning the devil might give. But when God questions him, he cannot hide his real motive: âI am better than himâÂ (Qur&#8217;an 38:76). Thus, any pretense Iblis may have had of submitting to nothing other than God is exposed. There is something here that he places before Allah. Here is the real meaning of Iblisâ rebellion, and also, ultimately, of the notion that arrogance and irreverence toward the rest of creation, and humanity, in particular, is somehow an expression ofÂ tawhid, or the purity of oneâs faith in Godâs unity and uniqueness. In light of this, it is ironic that the likes of Daesh are accusing others of devil worship.\nBut God commanded the angels to bow to Adam, the first human and, therefore, the father of humanity. So letâs put aside the sources of confusion. God did not command the angels to worship other than Him when he commanded the angels to bow to Adam. On the contrary, in bowing to Adam at Godâs command, they performed an act of worshipânot to Adam, but to none other than God. And this act of worship to none other than God was an act expressing reverence toward Adam, to whom God decreed that reverence should be expressed, through an act as humble as bowing.Â Those, then, who would charge the angels with idolatry, for obeying Godâs command to bow to Adam, may as well make the same charge against those who obey Godâs command to love the Prophet Muhammad ï·º.Â Thus, we need not debate what the Yezidis believe or what other people believe. Instead, let us concentrate on what God commands. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â \nSpecifically, if the angels are commanded to express reverence to Adam, then what are the implications for us? Is Adam not even more deserving of our reverence? Of course, we revere Adam as a prophet. But it is important to remember that the first prophet was also the first human. Humanity and prophethood share the same root. This leads me to conclude that Godâs decree of reverence for Adam is at the same time a decree of reverence for humanity. Is this a hasty conclusion? The stature and status of the average human, like you and I, is not equivalent to that of Adam. He was a prophet and we are not. He was the father of humanity, and we are just his children. By some reports, he was sixty feet tall, and we are six if weâre lucky. But still, he is the root of humanity and we are its branches. His blood runs in our veins. And, like all prophets, he is an exemplar for humanityâa God-given model of humanity at its most perfect. And âAllah does not burden a soul beyond what it is capable ofâ (Qurâan 2:286). So a prophet actually embodies nothing more than the fully realized potential of any human beingâwhat we would be if we were all that we could be. But, of course, we are not all that we could be. âVerily, we created humanity in the best mold. Then we reduced him to the lowest of the lowâ (Qurâan 95:4-5). And yet, we could be. âExcept those who believe and do righteous deeds. They will have a reward without end (Qurâan 95:6).â So the command to bow to Adam is also a command to revere the potential inherent in every human being. Â  Â \nReverence for the Divine is therefore impossible without reverence for the human. Likewise, true reverence for the human is impossible without reverence for the Divine. In relation to this position, two opposite extremes can be conceived. One is that reverence for God requires the rejection of reverence for the human. The other is that reverence for the human requires the rejection of reverence for God. The first extreme has appeared, historically, in the guise of various so-called âfundamentalismsââboth religious and secular. It seems to be the implicit rationale that motivatesÂ takfiriÂ extremism. The second extreme is the primary premise of the secular âhumanismâ that claims reverence for humanity as its rationale for atheism and the elimination of all forms of religion.\nEach of these extremes has its epistemological dimension. The claim that true reverence for humanity requires rejecting the Divine is co-entailed by belief in the self-sufficiency of the human intellect, such that trusting in God in matters beyond oneâs own understanding is a degrading humiliation unfit for the human being. On the other hand, those who claim that true reverence for the Divine requires rejecting the human, are fond of emphasizing the fallibility of the human intellect and then claiming to have achieved a kind of infallibility by circumventing the intellect altogether and relying exclusively and directly on revelation.\nThe latterâthe so-called âfundamentalistsââare correct in pointing out that the intellect isÂ fallible. But they slander it by depicting it as essentiallyÂ despicable, and they lie when they claim not to make use of it in understanding their religion. For guidance from revelation is not possible without understanding the revelation, and understanding the revelation is not possible without the intellect. So the fallibility of the intellect necessarily leads to fallibility in our understanding of revelation, and that is simply the human condition. Since nobody can claim to avoid this,Â epistemic humility is a moral necessity. But since this is either very difficult or very frightening for some people, they resort to claiming the ability to bypass the human intellect and its fallibility. In doing so, they prove that the intellect is fallible andÂ canÂ be despicable, but not that it need be.\nThe procedure for many Muslim so-called âfundamentalistsâ involves acknowledging that the Qurâan must be understood, but then claiming that we can insulate our understanding of it from the fallibility of the intellect by relying on the Sunnah, as if the Sunnah itself does not require understanding. How is it that a verse from the Qurâan cannot be understood without aÂ hadeethÂ from the Prophet ï·º or one of theÂ salafÂ to explain it, but theÂ hadeethÂ which is supposed to explain the verse can be understood just fine all on its own? Of course, everything requires understanding, and hence depends on the human intellect, with all its fallibility.Â HadeethÂ have to be authenticated, their contexts understood, etc. This systematic intellectual undertaking requires methodological principles that require a basis in reason as much as they do revelation. There is just no way around it.\nBut the easiest way to make the point is to ask, why was Islam not revealed to stones instead of human beings? It is not just because stones cannot fire KalashnikovsÂ because apparently they can. No. What makes humans different from stones are the heart and the intellect. Godâs message is addressed to the heart through the intellect, with all its fallibility, and potential despicability. The fundamentalistsâ flight from the intellect, their pretense of not depending on it in their understanding of religion, is just the epistemological dimension of their flight from humanity itselfâtheir notion that reverence for God requires contempt for the human, along with creation in general. Essentially, the âfundamentalistâ claims to transcend his own humanity, to understand Godâs message without the aid of his own fallible intellect, and so basically to speak directly and infallibly with Godâs voice. Of course, he will not explicitly say so, because in any case, he will deny that it is he who is speaking. So the incredible arrogance of his stance is cloaked in a kind of false humility. These are not his thoughts. Oh no, he has no thoughts of his own. He is only âdelivering the message.â Indeed, the intellect is fallible andÂ canÂ be despicable.\nBut as we mentioned, this contempt for the intellect represents only the epistemological dimension of a general contempt for the human in the name of God. Some of its other manifestations are more evident in the Muslim world today. There is a race to degrade and destroy the human, and not just betweenÂ takfiriÂ militant groups executing human beings on video and destroying human heritage. What can we say about regimes that oppress and kill their own human subjectsÂ en masse, and the supposedly moderate âtraditionalâ scholars who are silent when these human beings are disposed of, but then raise a cry whenÂ takfiriÂ militants raze a tomb? And we have been told that a single human being is more sacred than theÂ KaabaÂ (Sunan Ibn Majah 3932). It is clear that disregard for the sanctity of the human being among Muslims today is not limited to just one faction in the petty competition for political power through religious authority.\nAll this might lead one to believe that the secular âhumanistsâ at the other extreme are correct and that reverence for the human does require denial of the Divine. But what they overlook is that even if the intellect were infallible, and humansÂ wereÂ thoroughly rational, we would find no grounds for reverence for humanity on the basis of reason alone. The angels could not find it when God told them He would place aÂ khalifaÂ in the earth. âThey said: âWill you place therein those who will make mischief and shed bloodâwhile we glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You?ââ (Qur&#8217;an 2:30). God is perfect, and the angels obey Him perfectly. What could possibly be added to that by bringing about a creature that can disobey? Why would God create such a creature, and furthermore command the angels to bow to it? âHe said: âI know that which you do not know.ââ (Qur&#8217;an 2:30).\nIf the angels donât know, then we will not pretend to. In the view of the angels, with the extent of their knowledge, the creation of the human being could serve no aim other than to bring about corruption and destruction. Given what we have seen and are seeing wrought by our own bloody hands today, if the redeeming purpose God has in all this is beyond even their comprehension, then what real hope could someone possibly find in the human race, without trusting, blindly as it were, in something beyond oneâs ability to understand?Â Surely, from the perspective of reason alone, the human race is a plague waiting for a cure. But Allah says, âI know what you do not know.â\nThe secular, self-styled âhumanist,â however, says,Â âNobody knows what I (weâ¦?) donât know.â And yet, he doesnât know why it would not be better for the human race to never have existed at all. He is increasingly convinced that it would have. The only premises that he will allow as rationally defensible lead eventually and inevitably to the conclusion that human life is without any particular value that outweighs the suffering it brings, and that it would be, by any objective measure, better if human beings just stopped reproducing altogether. This, statistically, is one of the rare instances of a philosophical moral proposition that actually has a measurable effect on the real behavior of people in secularized societies. So much, then, for secular âhumanism.â Reverence for the Divineâbelief in God and trust that He has a plan for humanity beyond our comprehensionâis the only thing that makes any real and honest reverence for humanity possible.\nRegarding human destiny, what can be arrived at through reason alone is, I think, succinctly expressed in Qurâanic verses like the one just mentioned: âVerily we created humanity in the best of molds, and then reduce him to the lowest of the lowâ (Qur&#8217;an 95:4-5), and also, âBy time, verily man is in lossâ (Qur&#8217;an 103:1-2). These express a perennial realization, shared by reflective people throughout history, and captured, for example, in the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism. But that which is arrived at only through faith in God, and openness to His message, is expressed in those verses that, in each case, directly follow: âexcept those who believe and act righteouslyâ¦â. Here, God shows us that the path to His promiseâthe mystery of which is known only to Him, and which alone justifies the creation of Adam, Godâs command for the angels to bow, and the reverence for humanity that this entailsâis the only genuinely grounded humanism possible.\nGod said that He created humanity andÂ jinnÂ for no purpose other than to worship HimâimanÂ andÂ amal salih. TheÂ hadeethÂ tell us that the value of our deedsâthe condition of their righteousnessârests on the intentions behind them. And thus, âThere is no compulsion in religion. Verily the right has been distinguished from the wrongâ (Qur&#8217;an 2:256). Purity of intention requires that the act be a real choice, free from all forms of compulsionâphysical or psychological. A creature that obeys God willingly must of necessity be one with the capacity and opportunity to willingly disobey. Any attempt to negate that capacity, then, amounts to an attempt to obstruct the human being from the purpose of his or her creation.\nFreedom, in the proper sense, is, therefore, a necessary condition of any human moral value. Simply put, people cannot be forced to be good, or manipulated into being good, or brainwashed into being good. Of course, they can be forced, manipulated, brainwashed, or otherwise coerced into doing that whichÂ wouldÂ have real moral valueÂ ifÂ they were to do so freely. But doing so under coercion would be morally worthless. This is the premise of what can fairly be called the liberalism of Islam. I use the term âliberalismâ here insofar as it has been used to refer to a similar insight expressed by some modern European thinkers, notably Kant (d. 1804). However, we must differ with him, along with many strains of modern thought on this question, by also asserting that freedom alone is not a sufficient condition for any human moral value.\nWhat do we mean by this? First, we agree that no deed of any moral value can be done that is not done by autonomous, voluntary choice. Second, it follows from this that any act done with the intention of unjustly violating the autonomy of another is wrong. We differ, however, with the notion that this exhausts the morally significant considerations. An act can be freely done, not violate anyone elseâs freedom, and still be either morally worthless or wrong. This is what I mean by saying that, while freedom is a necessary condition for any human moral value, it is not a sufficient condition for any human moral value. Another way to put this is that, while the value of oneâs action depends on its being done freely, the value of oneâs freedom depends on what one does with it. Respect for human autonomy, then, does not follow from freedom being an unconditional value, because it is not an unconditional value. It follows, rather, from freedom being unconditionally necessary for the human act to have any value at all.\nIn asserting this, I am resisting the common trend in the west to reduce all morality to the principle of autonomy, to enshrine freedom as the only objective moral value, and to relegate all other moral considerations as merely subjective individual preferences, or culturally relative âfetishes.â This is crucial to distinguish the true Islamic liberalism from the dominant strands of Western liberalism which, I argue, are ultimately empty, incoherent, and therefore impossible to realize in practice. Therefore, when I speak of Islamic liberalism, I mean nothing like what is currently being marketed as âliberal Islam.â\nFor the fact of having the capacity to choose can only be objectively valuable and meaningful if it is the case that some concrete choices are objectively better than others. If all concrete choices are taken as morally equivalent by any objective standardâthat is, if the value of any concrete choice is merely a subjective matterâthen there is no objective value in being able to choose. In wrongly enshrining autonomy as the only objective moral value, western liberalism has declared us free, while rendering that freedom, along with our lives, ultimately meaningless.\nBut to be fair, the sort of liberalism I am opposing here does not directly consider all concrete choices as morally equivalent. What it does claim is that the only objective measure of the moral value of a concrete choice lies with the question of whether the choice violates the principle of autonomy. Simply put, the only thing that makes any action objectively wrong is that it would unjustly restrict anotherâs freedom to act; and the only objective measure of its goodness is the degree to which it expands the freedom to act, without, of course, unjustly restricting it. This entails that the only objective standard by which to distinguish a just restriction of freedom from an unjust restriction lies, again, in whether the restriction in question involves an act that would itself unjustly restrict the freedom of others. In other words, the only justification for limiting anyoneâs rights is to protect the rights of others. We can already see how this will lead to circularity, without providing any real definition as to what rights are universal. This, essentially, is why this form of liberalism turns out to be theoretically incoherent and practically impossible.\nThere are various answers to this problem on offer, and in all fairness, one would have to treat each in detail in order to argue that the problem is insoluble. But that would be a lengthy discussion outside the scope of what I can do here. Let me, then, simply articulate the following position, in laying out an initial defense and clarification of what I take to be âIslamic liberalism.â The only way to sufficiently and coherently define the just limits of individual freedom, is by reference to a substantive objective conception of the good, which is not reducible to the value of freedom alone, and the validity of which is not contingent on mere subjective preference. In other words, John Stuart Mill (d. 1873) was mistaken to claim that the only measure of the value of anything is whether someone desires it. And Immanuel Kant (d. 1804) was over-reaching when he claimed that his categorical imperative was alone sufficient to resolve all real moral questions.\nThis is just an introduction to what I see as the crucial project of defining and defending the nature of an âIslamic liberalismâ against the misguided, incoherent, and eventually imperialistic and destructive versions of liberalism that currently dominate western culture. Of course, this project requires a more detailed demonstration of the fallacies of these false liberalisms than I have had occasion to present here. More importantly, the practical, ethical, and political implications of Islamic liberalism need to be drawn out more fully. This means that a comprehensive and clear set of principles for distinguishing just from unjust restrictions of freedom needs to be drawn on the basis of a substantive Islamic conception of the good. In addition, there are various concepts of freedom, autonomy, and agency that need to be distinguished and clarified in terms of their relation to contingent material conditions of life, and their particular moral salience with regard to first-order moral judgments. This work will be crucial, not only for defending the integrity of Islam from destructive, incoherent notions of liberty but most importantly for clarifying and defending the rightful value of human freedom under an Islamic liberalism, to a Muslim world which, sadly but undeniably, seems gravely and dangerously oblivious to it.\n\n\n[1]Â Â http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/iraq-yazidis-islamic-state-sinjar-2014856612595603.html\n\n\n[2]Â Â http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/11/world/meast/iraq-rescue-mission/index.html\n\n\n[3]Â http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/iraq-yazidis-living-fear-mount-sinjar-160726063155982.html\n\n\n[4]Â http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/iraq-yazidis-caught-crossfire-201462412464507378.html\n\n&nbsp;\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in these papers and articles are strictly those of the authors.

What exactly did this man accomplish? What fruits were born from his ministry? And do his achievements represent extraordinary talent and virtue, or mere hyperbolic adulation by his followers?\nIt should first be noted that Muhammadâs ï·º greatest accomplishment was not restricted to being the most adored person among his contemporaries and future generations for over a millennium, as true as that may be. It also was not restricted to momentary political dominance over wide regions, for had this been the case, one might consider him comparable to Constantine, Alexander the Great, or Genghis Khan. It also was not limited to an incident of religious inspiration that lives on for centuries, lest someone conflate it with Christendomâs account of the crucifixion. It also was not contained solely in an admirable lifestyle of self-restraint, existential wisdom, and benevolence, as is credited to Buddha and Confucius. No, there was something different about Muhammad ï·ºâsomething that leaves those who discover it awestruck. What was it? It was the fact that no single milestone immortalized his legacy, but rather a series of remarkable feats that converged in one person. This is what fascinated and bewildered so many over the past millennium and a half, leaving them wondering:Â Can this really be? Could such a person have existed outside of legends? Is there any other plausible explanation for this? Perhaps I really am standing before prophethood?\nJohn William Draper (d. 1882), an English-American scientist, physician, philosopher, and historian, writes,\n\nFour years after the death of Justinian, A.D. 569, was born in Mecca, in Arabia, the man who, of all men, has exercised the greatest influence upon the human raceâ¦ To be the religious head of many empires, to guide the daily life of one-third of the human race, may perhaps justify the title of a Messenger of God.[2]\n\nThere is no leap of faith required here, at least not in accepting his prophethood. Claiming that sheer luck is responsible for all of these accomplishments being combined in any one individual, let alone Muhammad ï·º, can only sprout from someone uninformed about reality or perverted by prejudice. Consider the enigma of a man who himself was illiterate, born in a backwards and feuding Arabia, isolated from the arts, philosophies, politics, warfare, and education of the developed empires surrounding it. Consider that this very man steps forwardâovernightâwith a call whose profundity, impact, and permanence remain peerless. The speed at which his religion spread, the global command of his call until today, and the positive influence of this single individual wasâand will remainâunparalleled in human history; and Draper was certainly not the only non-Muslim historian in the West who recognized this.\nAs Alphonse de Lamartine (d. 1869), a French historian, exquisitely put it,\n\nIf greatness of purpose, smallness of means, and astounding results are the three criteria of human genius, who could dare to compare any great man in modern history with Muhammad? The most famous men created arms, laws and empires only. They founded, if anything at all, no more than material powers which often crumbled away before their eyes. This man moved not only armies, legislations, empires, peoples and dynasties, but millions of men in one-third of the then inhabited world; and more than that, he moved the altars, the gods, the religions, the ideas, the beliefs and souls. On the basis of a Book, every letter of which has become law, he created a spiritual nationality which has blended together peoples of every tongue and of every race. He has left to us as the indelible characteristic of this Muslim nationality, the hatred of false gods and the passion for the One and immaterial God. This avenging patriotism against the profanation of Heaven formed the virtue of the followers of Muhammad: the conquest of one third of the earth to his creed was his miracle. The idea of the unity of God proclaimed amidst the exhaustion of fabulous theogonies, was in itself such a miracle that upon its utterance from his lips it destroyed all the ancient temples of idols and set on fire one third of the world. His life, his meditations, his heroic stance against the superstitions of his country, and his boldness in defying the furies of idolatry; his firmness in enduring them for thirteen years at Mecca, his acceptance of the role of public scorn and almost of being a victim of his fellow-countrymen: all these and, finally his incessant preaching, his wars against odds, his faith in his success and his superhuman security in misfortune, the forbearance in victory, his ambition, which was entirely devoted to one idea and in no manner striving for an empire; his endless prayers, his mystic conversations with God, his death and his triumph after death; all these attest not to an imposture but to a firm conviction which gave him the power to restore a dogma. This dogma was twofold, the unity of God and the immateriality of God; the former telling what God is, the latter telling what God is not; the one overthrowing false gods with the sword, the other starting an idea with words.Â Philosopher, orator, apostle, legislator, warrior, conqueror of ideas, restorer of rational dogmas, of a cult without images, the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire; that is Muhammad. As regards all the standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask: is there any man greater than he?[3]\n\nA Love Larger than Life\nHas anyone in human history ever been as deeply loved as the Prophet Muhammad ï·º? Many underestimate, or perhaps are unfamiliar with, the esteem and emulation this figure has garnered for a second millennium now. Others may realize it, then hastily assume that just-as-impressive shares of adoration must have been achieved by somebody else in human history. But a more critical examination tells another story.\nDuring his life, the Prophetâs Companions yearned to sacrifice life and limb to defend him ï·º. When the Prophet ï·º was knocked unconscious during the Battle of UhÌ£ud, for instance, his Companions displayed extraordinary heroism as they rushed to his rescue. Abu DujaÌna (ra) welcomed volleys of arrows landing in his back as he hovered over the Prophet ï·º. Anas b. an-NadÌ£r (ra) dove into the crowds until over ninety wounds of sword, spear, and arrow were found on his martyred body. Abu TalhÌ£a (ra) shielded the Prophet ï·º from injury with his bare chest when he found nothing else, and pleaded with him after he revived, âDo not look, O Messenger of Allah! [I would rather] My neck [be struck] than yours!â TalhÌ£a b. âUbaydillaÌh (ra) lifted the Prophet ï·º onto a boulder, then returned to drive back the onslaught, then returned yet again to bring the Prophet ï·º to even safer ground. Nusayba b. Kaâb (ra) was a fearless woman who snatched swords away from men and charged at many pshysically stronger warriors at UhÌ£ud, until she fell to a saber-strike on her collarbone which would hemorrhage later to grant her martyrdom. By the time the dust had finally cleared, their selfless displays of love for the Prophet ï·º were eternalized in history forever. Upon returning to the city of Madinah, a woman from the Banu DinaÌr tribe was told that her husband, father, and brother were all killed at UhÌ£ud. She retorted, âBut what happened to the Messenger of Allah ï·º?â They replied, âHe is safe and well, just as you wish him to be.â She said, âShow him to me; I must see for myself.â When she finally saw him, she said, âEvery tragedy besides [losing] you is insignificant, O Messenger of Allah.â[4]Â This single dayâs events, not all captured here, are but a microcosm reflecting the ethos of love and endearment that surrounded the Final Prophet of God ï·º for the duration of his twenty-three-year ministry.\nA few years after UhÌ£ud, âUrwa b. MasâuÌd came as an envoy of the then enemy tribe of Quraysh, seeking to negotiate a treaty with Muhammad ï·º. After spending three days among the Muslims, he returned to Mecca and briefed Quraysh with these observations:\n\nO gathering of Quraysh, I have visited Chosroes [of Persia] in his kingdom, and Caesar [of Rome] in his kingdom, and the Negus [of Abyssinia] in his kingdom. But by God, I have never seen a king so revered among a people like Muhammad. He does not wash himself except that they rush to catch the droplets of water [falling from his body], nor does one of his hairs fall except that they take it. Whenever he speaks, they immediately lower their voices, and none stares at him directly out of reverence for him. He has offered you good terms, so accept them, for I do not see them ever deserting him. Now make yourÂ decision.[5]\n\nEven decades after the Prophetâs ï·º death, we find a Companion like âAmr b. al-âÃsÌ£ (ra) laying on his deathbed reminiscing about his life prior to Islam, recalling how he transformed from being a militant adversary of the Prophet ï·º to one of his greatest followers. Amidst his recollections, he says,\n\nThen, no one was dearer to me than the Messenger of Allah ï·º, and none was more exalted in my eyes than him. I could not even stare at him directly out of reverence for him, and thus if I am asked to describe his features, I would not be able to describe them, for I have never eyed him fully.[6]Â \n\nThe Companions who outlived the Prophet ï·º burned with similar passion and longing; an entire generation who remained incapable of hearing his name without their hearts trembling, their eyes overflowing with tears, anticipating reuniting with him in the hereafter. BilaÌl b. RabaÌhÌ£ (ra) was a freed Ethiopian slave who was among the first handful to accept Islam at the hands of the Prophet ï·º, tolerating unthinkable torture for defying his masters and embracing the religion of Muhammad. He would survive to become the very firstÂ muezzinÂ (caller to prayer) in Muslim history. Needless to say, loving Muhammad ï·º flowed in BilaÌlâs veins, and surviving him brought him sorrow that only a reunion could heal. Nine years later, as BilaÌl (ra) lay on his own deathbed in Damascus, he heard his wife say, âO my grief! O my BilaÌl!â To that, he retorted, âO my joy! Tomorrow I meet my loved ones: Muhammad and his companions!â[7]\nCountless thousands have since inherited this love of the Final Prophet ï·º en route to becoming icons of truth, justice, and contribution in world history. Among these were vanguards who developed profound insight into sacred truths, performed tangible and intellectual wonders, and ascended to rare heights in the footsteps of their beloved, the unlettered Prophet ï·º. Innumerable meticulous scholars, literary geniuses, selfless altruists, accomplished statesmen, and virtuous generals believed emulating Muhammad ï·º was the gateway to true excellence in all endeavors and indispensable for being a torchbearer for humanity. Even today, nearly a third of this planet continues to govern their livesâin one respect or anotherâin ways that reflect their veneration of Muhammad ï·º. Muslims certainly do not worship Muhammad, only God, but see his persona as their earthly pivot of faith, and his example as the paragon of virtue and thereby their conduit to GodâsÂ pleasure.\n\nThroughout the Muslim world, it is customary to say âMay the peace and blessings of God be upon himâ after mentioning the Prophet. As a result, during the Friday communal prayer any mention of the Prophetâs name by the preacher during the sermon will elicit a collective murmur of prayers for Muhammad from the congregation. In such settings, the person of the Prophet becomes the common focus of Muslimsâ ritual attention. Remembering Muhammad and honouring his Sunnah act as the earthly focal point from which attention is directed upward to God.[8]Â \n\nToday, the Muslimsâ exaltation of the man who connected them with their Creator has made âMuhammadâ the mostÂ popular baby name in London, where Muslims to date account for only about 12% of the population. Generation after generation, his devout followers continue exploring his every word, rigorously pursuing everything traceable to him, and mimicking his lifestyle down to the motions of his fingers during prayer. How many figures in human history have won such adoration, an adoration that translated into actions, for fifteen centuries and counting?\nDavid George Hogarth (d. 1927), a British scholar and archeologist, said,\n\nSerious or trivial, his daily behavior has instituted a canon which millions observe this day with conscious memory. No one regarded by any section of the human race as Perfect Man has ever been imitated so minutely. The conduct of the founder of Christianity has not governed the ordinary life of his followers. Moreover, no founder of a religion has left on so solitary an eminence as the Muslim apostle.[9]\n\nIt is fascinating that Muhammadâs name foretold this phenomenon before its occurrence.Â MuhammadÂ literally means âthe oft-praised one,â and no person in humanity has received greater praise and recognition than he ï·º. Even without the exposure opportunities of social media, without an account on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or Whatsapp, Muhammad ï·º has amassed 1.6 billion followers in todayâs world. Does it not stir amazement to consider how with this one human being, 1400 years after he passed away, there is no second that passes except that he is praised all around the world? In the Muslim call to prayer (adhaÌn) which takes place every second around the world, followed by the prayer (sÌ£alaÌh) itself, supplicating for Muhammad and testifying to his prophethood is echoed day and night. Should one not marvel at just how emotionally attached people remain to Muhammad, and how they continue to express the most passionate defense of him when he is slighted?\nIn fact, God had Himself foretold this by saying, âAnd we have raised for you your repute.â[10]Â This verse was revealed during the early Meccan years, at a time when the Muslims were a mere handful of weak people and it was unsure what would happen to Islam, but to think how the verse is fulfilled now, when Muhammad ï·º is mentioned and remembered by hundreds of millions of people all over the world is incredible.\nThe Worldâs Greatest Success Story\nAppreciation of his teachings aside, a momentary glance at just the Prophetâs ï·º life and his âsecular successâ has demanded attention from scholars worldwide.\nAs Karen Armstrong, an acclaimed author on comparative religion, puts it,\n\nIslam is a religion of success. Unlike Christianity, which has as its main image, in the west at least, a man dying in a devastating, disgraceful, helpless deathâ¦ Mohammed was not an apparent failure. He was a dazzling success, politically as well as in spirituality, and Islam went from strength to strength to strength.[11]\n\nMichael Hart, another contemporary American historian, who authoredÂ The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, succinctly illustrates this mind-boggling success story as follows:\n\nMy choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world&#8217;s most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular levels. Of humble origins, Muhammad founded and promulgated one of the world&#8217;s great religions, and became an immensely effective political leader. Today, thirteen centuries after his death, his influence is still powerful and pervasive. The majority of the persons in this book had the advantage of being born and raised in centers of civilization, highly cultured or politically pivotal nations. Muhammad, however, was born in the year 570, in the city of Mecca, in southern Arabia, at that time a backward area of the world, far from the centers of trade, art, and learning. Orphaned at age six, he was reared in modest surroundings. Islamic tradition tells us that he was illiterate. His economic position improved when, at age twenty-five, he married a wealthy widow. Nevertheless, as he approached forty, there was little outward indication that he was a remarkable person.\nMost Arabs at that time were pagans, who believed in many gods. There were, however, in Mecca, a small number of Jews and Christians; it was from them no doubt that Muhammad first learned of a single, omnipotent God who ruled the entire universe. When he was forty years old, Muhammad became convinced that this one true God (Allah) was speaking to him, and had chosen him to spread the true faith. For three years, Muhammad preached only to close friends and associates. Then, about 613, he began preaching in public. As he slowly gained converts, the Meccan authorities came to consider him a dangerous nuisance. In 622, fearing for his safety, Muhammad fled to Medina (a city some 200 miles north of Mecca), where he had been offered a position of considerable political power.\nThis flight, called the Hegira, was the turning point of the Prophet&#8217;s life. In Mecca, he had few followers. In Medina, he had many more, and he soon acquired an influence that made him a virtual dictator. During the next few years, while Muhammadâs following grew rapidly, a series of battles were fought between Medina and Mecca. This was ended in 630 with Muhammad&#8217;s triumphant return to Mecca as conqueror. The remaining two and one-half years of his life witnessed the rapid conversion of the Arab tribes to the new religion. When Muhammad died, in 632, he was the effective ruler of all of southern Arabia. The Bedouin tribesmen of Arabia had a reputation as fierce warriors. But their number was small; and plagued by disunity and internecine warfare, they had been no match for the larger armies of the kingdoms in the settled agricultural areas to the north. However, unified by Muhammad for the first time in history, and inspired by their fervent belief in the one true God, these small Arab armies now embarkedÂ upon one of the most astonishing series of conquests in human history.[12]\n\nAs Lamartine said earlier, it was not just the astonishing series of conquests and worldly success that made Muhammad unique. Rather, it was theÂ meagerÂ means through which he accomplished this, the selfless relinquishment of his material gains once heÂ attained them, andÂ the retention ofÂ his transcendent purpose despiteÂ all these accomplishments, that marked his greatness.\nBosworth Smith (d. 1908), a reverend schoolmaster and author, writes,\n\nBy a fortune absolutely unique in history, Mohammed is a threefold founder of a nation, of an empire, and of a religionâ¦ Head of the State as well as the Church; he was Caesar and Pope in one; but he was Pope without the Popeâs pretensions, and Caesar without the legions of Caesar, without a standing army, without a bodyguard, without a police force, without a fixed revenue. If ever a man ruled by a right divine, it was Muhammad, for he had all the powers without their supports. He cared not for the dressings of power. The simplicity of his private life was in keeping with his public life.[13]\n\nThat final sentence from Smith is what some consider theÂ reason forÂ Muhammadâs ï·º unprecedented power and undying influence. It was the combined fact of successfully winning control over so much of this world while not allowing an iota of it to control him. Muslims believe that only God could have fused these two phenomena inside one man, and that He reinforced his claim to prophethood with these material and moral triumphs. As Edward Gibbon puts it,\n\nThe greatest success of Muhammadâs life was effected by sheer moral forceâ¦ It is not the propagation but the permanency of his religion that deserves our wonder, the same pure and perfect impression which he engraved at Mecca and Medina is preserved after the revolutions of twelve centuries by the Indian, the African and the Turkish proselytes of the Koranâ¦[14]\n\nSimilarly, after the renownedÂ Mahatma GandhiÂ (d. 1948) found himself in prison with the Prophetâs biography, he was able to identify the secret behind the Prophet ï·º overcoming insurmountable odds and reaching such stations of global success. He says,\n\nI wanted to know the best of the life of one who holds today an undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankindâ¦ I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle.[15]\n\nRestoring the Unity of God\nThe Final Prophet ï·º accomplished the rare feat of providing the world with impeccable clarity on the identity of God, His oneness, and His perfection, a clarity that aligned with both human nature and rationality, and thus became the hallmark of Islam. He proposed a simple and intuitive theology that described to people their Creator, and the path to Him, in a way that was bound to spread like wildfire all across the globe. It was a unique proposal, one that struck such a deep chord in humanity that it effectively stripped them of some of their most hindering tendenciesâsuch as the blind conformity that all cultures perpetuate, and the deification of people that has occurred in so many civilizations. Muhammad ï·º unearthed for a vulnerable world their long-lost sanctuary; direct access to the One True God, the Most Merciful. He ï·º refused to rest until they knew that only through singling God out in devotion would one find contentment and satisfaction, and that only through Him would their moral compasses be set aright. For those who understand that only disorder can exist outside an authentic God-centric lifestyle, the incalculable utility of this single accomplishment by Muhammad ï·º can be realized. Restoring the unity of God in peopleâs lives resulted in restoring order and meaning to life, as it did away with the notion of life being a destination-less journey. And for those incapable of seeing the utility of an authentic theology in our age, perhaps a good start is considering the emerging fascination with âspiritual intelligenceâ in the turmoil-filled modern world, along with theÂ significantly lower homicide and suicide rates in Muslim countriesÂ (also see:Â Suicide and Islam; NCBI).\nAlphonse de Lamartine says on this point,\n\nNever has a man proposed for himself, voluntarily or involuntarily, a goal more sublime, since this goal was beyond measure: undermine the superstitions placed between the creature and the Creator, give back God to man and man to God, reinstate the rational and saintly idea of divinity in the midst of this prevailing chaos of material and disfigured gods of idolatry. Never has a man accomplished in such short time such an immense and long lasting revolution in the world, since less than two centuries after his prediction, Islam, preaching and armed,Â ruled over three Arabias and conquered to Godâs unity Persia, the Khorasan of Transoxania, Western India, Syria, Egypt, Abyssinia, and all the known continent of Northern Africa, many islands of the Mediterranean, Spain, and part of Gaul.[16]\n\nEdward Gibbon adds,\n\nThe Mahometans have uniformly withstood the temptation of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to a level with the senses and imagination of man. âI believe in One God and Mahomet the Apostle of Godâ is the simple and invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honors of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue, and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason andÂ religion.[17]\n\nThis purest conceptualization of monotheism was inculcated into the followers of Prophet Muhammad ï·º: an absolutely personal relationship with God, one void of every intermediary and human interference.Â This strict monotheism placed all men and women on equal footing before God and with equal access to God. This helped shape the egalitarian nature of Islam, providing a social narrative in which the holiness of men was not evidenced in their material possessions or social class, but rather in their acts of piety and righteousness.\nFurthermore, the theology he brought either explained away or absorbed the other religions and competing theologies about God, consolidating all into one coherent monotheistic worldview. This was the explanatory power of Islam which gave it immense intellectual appeal: its compelling ability to satisfy all the existential questions about God and creation. As for its spiritual appeal, that too was a driving force behind its continued imprint on the minds and hearts of people. After all, the greatest miracle of Muhammad ï·º (see forthcoming article: The Prophetâs Miracles) was the Quran which stands as Godâs verbatim address to humanity, available to be imbibed firsthand by anyone who studies it until the end of time.\nRevolutionizing Human Rights\nAfter rectifying manâs bond with his Maker, mending peopleâs relationships with one another was the natural next step. This accomplishment of the Final Prophet ï·º was not merely one of advocating for virtues such as kindness, empathy, and humility in peopleâs interpersonal exchanges, but also one that involved setting a flawless system in play to ensure that these abstract concepts would unfold on the ground. He ï·º fraternized with all people, despite their differences, and purged their prejudices, and said in his Farewell Sermon, âO people, your Lord is one, and your father is one. You are all from Adam, and Adam is from dust. The noblest among you in the sight of God is the mostÂ God-conscious.â[18]Â Islam affirmed a universal human brotherhood, a brotherhood that recognized the dignity of every human being, and demanded an end to every form of bigotry based on race, color, or class. What is more, the universal brotherhood that Islam established was based on cooperation between people for the upliftment of society and humanity as a whole.\nHumanity has suffered countless casualties based on social classification. Some based it on lineage (ethnic patriotism), others on financial standing (socioeconomic class), and others on skin color (racial supremacy). Historically, these distinctionsÂ led toÂ more than just bitter arguments, but also endless hatred, conflict, and generations of carnage. Islam came to a people that were knee-deep in feudal discriminatory tendencies and transformed that society into a model of social harmonyÂ in which all were liberated from the shackles of discrimination, andÂ âsuperiorityâ was based onlyÂ onÂ pietyâwhichÂ only God could judge and all could compete for.\nArnold Toynbee (d. 1975), a research professor of international history at the University of London, in his bookÂ Civilization on TrialÂ said,\n\nThe extinction of race consciousness as between Muslims is one of the outstanding moral achievements of Islam, and in the contemporary world there is, as it happens, a crying need for the propagation of this Islamic virtue.[19]\n\nSome may argue that what the Prophet ï·º did was even more brilliant than eliminating bigotry and racism; rather he argued that racial and linguistic diversity should be appreciated and embraced.\nThe late Malik Shabazz, aka Malcolm X, recognized this in his famous 1964Â Letter from Mecca,\n\nAmerica needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem. Throughout my travels in the Muslim world, I have met, talked to, and even eaten with people who in America would have been considered whiteâbut the white attitude was removed from their minds by the religion of Islam. I have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color.[20]\n\nCertainly, it was not just racism that the Prophet ï·º eradicated when establishing social justice, but tyrannical classism as well. When one considers just how much human rights are but a political philosophy in our modern times, a veneer to justify capitalistically driven wars, itâs no wonder why historians marvel at the moral accomplishments of Muhammad. Certainly, sincere people of conscience who genuinely advocate for human rights do exist everywhere, but who among todayâs world powers operates with the ethical consistency of Muhammad ï·º at the height of his power? He did not celebrate the universalism of humanity while upholding the interests of the rising bourgeois, nor was he a mobilizer of mobs disgruntled by economic woes. Rather, there was a pristine equity in his call, one that validated the wealth of the wealthy and the power of the powerful, whenever this wealth was not the fruit of exploitation or hoarding, and whenever this power did not translate into domination or authoritarianism. He uplifted the downtrodden and humbled the affluent, joining them at a beautiful middle called brotherhood. And for generations after the Final Prophet ï·º returned to God, you could find a civilization replete with justice and security for the rich, poor, Muslim, and non-Muslim alikeâcompletely unlike the selective human rights that ruthless corporations and abusive policing practice today. With dictates like, âPay the worker his due wages before his sweat dries,â[21]Â and âAllah will surely torment those who torment people in this worldly life,â[22]Â the Prophet ï·º eradicated the widely condoned inequities of his time.\nAbu Dharr (ra), a senior Companion of the Prophet ï·º, could not be differentiated from his laborers as they wore identical clothing. When asked about this, he explained that the Prophet ï·º had said,Â âYour servants are your brothers whom Allah has placed under your authority. Whoeverâs brother is under his authority should feed him with the same food he eats, clothe him with the same clothes he wears, andÂ notÂ burden him beyond his ability. And if you burden him, then help him.â[23]Â In fact, biographers report that another senior companion Abu ad-DardaÌâ (ra) said to his riding mount as it died, âO camel, do not prosecute me before your Lord, for I never made you carry more than you could bear!â âUrwa b. Muhammad (ra), the grandson of another great Companion, declared upon assuming the governorship of Yemen, âO Yemenites! This here is my camel. If I exit [your lands] with anything more than it, then I am a thief.â[24]\nIt is well beyond the scope of this paper to even begin to outline the various human rights the Prophet Muhammad ï·º established and the atrocious conditions he uprooted during his lifetime. Dignity and respect for women and justice for non-Muslims, not to mention rights for even animals and the environment, must all be deferred to discussions elsewhere. But to marvel at these accomplishments, even when contrasting them with todayâs standards which enjoy over a century of refining âhuman rights theories,â a good primer I would suggest isÂ Civilization of Faith: A Journey Through Islamic History, by Dr. MustÌ£afa as-SibaÌâee.\nProducing a Model Generation\nOver theÂ span of just twenty&#8211;three years, the Prophet ï·º successfully designed a model generation whose likes humanity had never seenÂ and will never again see. This was a group isolated from the world by oceans of desert, weak and largely illiterate, and hardly more than sheepherders. Within two decades, they somehow transformed the world forever. But how? They had become the purest servants of God in human history after the prophets,Â the most dutiful observers of monotheism on the planet. This not only made them the most devout worshippers but alsoÂ atÂ theÂ forefront ofÂ contributing to humanity. At night, they would stand in prayer longing for the Divine, tearsÂ streamingÂ down their cheeks in reflection over His revealed Word. By day, they would live for purposes greater than themselves, exhausting themselves in philanthropy, education, or as knights who rode to liberate humanity from tyrannical regimes. They brought justice to the nations, as Isaiah foretold they would,[25]Â and unleashed the potential of hundreds of thousands of ascetics, reformers, and great thinkers for centuries. In the global Muslim community, there emerged a civilizationÂ in whichÂ virtue and chastity were the norm, andÂ in whichÂ alcohol was neverÂ widespread. Until this very day, as the World Health Organization estimates that alcohol results in 2.5 million deaths a year, the impact of Islam on preventingÂ alcohol abuseÂ inÂ Muslim-majority nations isÂ glaring.\n\nThe hallmarks of Islamic civilization were justice and equality, balance and moderation, diversity, progress, and the pursuit of beauty. People traveled across the seas seeking to export these virtues to their homelands, and multitudes of honest experts testify that the world has never been the same since.\nAdam Smith (d. 1790), the 18thÂ century English economist that pioneered the Westâs free market system, admits,\n\nThe Empire of the Caliphs seems to have been the first state under which the world enjoyed that degree of tranquility which the cultivation of the sciences requires. It was under the protection of those generous and magnificent princes, that the ancient philosophy and astronomy of the Greeks were restored and established in the East; that tranquility, which their mild, just and religious government diffused over their vast empire, revived the curiosity of mankind, to inquire into the connecting principles of nature.[26]\n\nWilliam Draper, whose praise of Muhammad was earlier cited, says in apology,\n\nI have to deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of Europe has contrived to put out of sight our scientific obligations to the Mohammedans. Surely they cannot be much longer hidden. Injustice founded on religious rancor and national conceit cannot be perpetuated forever.[27]\n\nBut even putting civilizational merits aside, focusing solely on the Prophetâs lifetime demands a sober pause. Has history ever known anyone else with the ability to wean a nation from alcoholism? The Prophet ï·º achieved that within his lifetime in a people whose glory and income was interlocked with wine. Has anyone else ever been able to ban the age-old customs of unrestricted polygyny, male-only inheritance laws, and female infanticide in less than one decade? All the laws in todayâs India combating female infanticide have not eradicated the practice after more than a century of strict enforcement.[28]Â Has there ever been another era where systemic racism was eradicated in both theory and practice? Many of the Prophetâs contemporaries who were vehement Arab supremacists ultimately became people who accepted being subordinates of non-Arabs and former slaves. Impartial readers of history would attest that each one of these is an astonishing accomplishment on its own, and yet these and more were actualized by the generation carved under his ï·º care.\nConclusion\nCaptured here are some of theÂ unique successes granted by God to the Final Prophet ï·º.Â HeÂ beganÂ byÂ transforming those under his tutelage from one of the most savage and lawless communities imaginable to the best communityÂ possible. Then, for nearly a millennium and especially during the earlier era, the Islamic civilization espoused a perfect balance between spirituality and morals and scientific vibrancy and progressive thought.\nFinally, it is understandable that the current incompetenceâin certain respectsâof Muslim nation-states today detractsÂ from our ability to appreciate the greatness of Islamic civilization. It helps to remember thatÂ it wasÂ only in the past 400 toÂ 500 yearsÂ thatÂ the Muslim world suffered these great setbacks, and only when the Muslims strayed away from the proper understanding and practice of Islam. But for as long as MuslimsÂ gaveÂ due respect to their religion, observedÂ it correctly and religiously, downfalls of this magnitude were non-existent. It is a demonstrable reality that Muslims continued doing well when adhering to Islam and the guidance of their Prophet ï·º, as opposed to other nations who only thrived once they quit practicing their faith. For this same reason, much of the modern world resists the notion of merging between âchurch and state,â because they feel religion is what kept them from progress. Many see the revival of religion as necessitating a return to backwardness and savagery. But in our experience, religion and spiritual strength were the driving force which motivated the early Muslims to excel in all fields. The discerning observer of history, and especially the Muslim, must make that distinction. This will not only shed many of the suspicions our modern culture caused us to inherit about religion at large but will also help one understand why discussing Islamâs contributions isÂ impossibleÂ with some people regardless of how many hard facts are presentedâbecause they begin the conversation with a completely different paradigm. But for someoneÂ starting withÂ a firm conviction that Muhammad was, in fact, the Messenger of God, it is clearly the case that these were some of his successes.\n\n\n[1]Â Matthew 7:16, KJV\n\n\n[2]Â See:Â History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, John William Draper, 1863\n\n\n[3]Â See:Â Histoire De La Turquie, by Alphonse de Lamartine\n\n\n[4]Â See: al-WaÌqidi,Â al-MaghaÌzi was-Siyar\n\n\n[5]Â See:Â Sahih al-BukhaÌriÂ (2529) andÂ as-SiÌraÂ byÂ Ibn HishaÌmÂ (2/312)\n\n\n[6]Â Collected by Muslim (711)\n\n\n[7]Â See:Â al-MuhÌ£tadÌ£ariÌnÂ (294) by Ibn Abi ad-DunyaÌ, andÂ at-TaÌrikhÂ (10/475) by Ibn âAsaÌkir\n\n\n[8]Â Brown, Jonathan AC,Â Muhammad: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press (2011)\n\n\n[9]Â Hogarth, David H.,Â Arabia, first published in 1923\n\n\n[10]Â SuÌrat ash-SharhÌ£ (94): 4\n\n\n[11]Â Transcribed: Bill Moyers Interviews Karen Armstrong, PBS, March 2002\n\n\n[12]Â See:Â The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, by Michael H.

Peace should be the normal state of affairs between people, regardless of differences in religion, philosophy, or anything else.Â Peace, however,Â is won at the cost of repellingÂ unjust aggressionÂ againstÂ innocent people. To this end, Islam and its scholarly tradition have laid down rules regarding warfare, both what justifies a declaration of war (jus ad bellum) and how a just war should be conducted after its declaration (jus in bello). The Islamic just war tradition, in fact, precedes and foreshadows a number of agreed-upon principles in modern just war theory.\nThis article focuses on the secondÂ partÂ of Islamâs just war theory: the specific rulings that prohibit the excessive use of force. These rules safeguard the lives and properties of civilians and the environment, mandate that prisoners of war be treated humanely, and forbid any military tactics involving the use of torture or terrorism.\nThe Principle of Non-Aggression\nA central principle that runs all throughout Islamic teachings on warfare isÂ that ofÂ non-aggression:Â one mustÂ never initiate aggression andÂ shouldÂ only respond to it proportionately. The basis of this principle is the saying of the Prophet ï·º, âDo not cause harmÂ nor return harm.â[1]Â This statement became one of the essential âfive maximsâ that govern all actions in Islamic law.[2]Â Every action that causes harm to another person or animal is forbidden by default, unless it is taken to secure a greater benefit or repel a greater harm according to the subsidiary principle, âGreater harm is removed by lesser harm.â[3]Â It is forbidden in Islam to remove a lesser harm with a greater harm.\nWar is one of the greatest of human activitiesÂ thatÂ causeÂ harmÂ toÂ people, animals, and the environment. Hence, it should not be undertaken except to repel an even greater harm as God said, âPersecution is worse than killing.â[4]Â The persecution condemned by this verse refers to the Quraish who violently suppressed the practice of Islam, preventing people from performing pilgrimage at the Sacred Mosque in Mecca and driving Muslims out of their homes for no reason other than theirÂ beliefs. War, which involves killing, is certainly an evil,Â but the evil of this religious persecution was greater. PersecutionÂ at that timeÂ involved theÂ violentÂ curtailment of freedom to practice faith and systematic violent oppression of the poor and weak. Islamic just war was instituted to ensure Muslims would not have to endure the same suffering as that of their predecessors.\nSometimes the historical prescriptions of Muslim scholars are interpreted in waysÂ that appear to violate the principle of non-aggression. For example, some jurists developed a concept of âoffensive jihadâ (jihad al-talab) whichÂ involvesÂ attackingÂ the enemy in their own lands. It is analogousÂ toÂ the Western concept of preemptive war, taking initiative against a credible threat. In the pre-modern world of expanding dynastic empires, such âoffensiveâ activities were deemed necessary for purposes of self-defense. As the Arabs would say, âWhen the Romans are not campaigned against, they campaign (against you).â[5]Â It is only in this sense that the verse, âFight in Godâs cause against those who fight you,â[6]Â was claimed by some jurists to be âabrogatedâ by the âverse of the sword.â As explained by the exegete Al-Badawi, the latter verses authorized war against âthose who fight youÂ or from whom that is expected.â[7]Â The principle of non-aggression itself was not abrogated or canceled, but rather Muslims were commanded to take the initiative againstÂ actualÂ threats to their safety, namely the Roman and Persian empires, instead of waiting to be attacked in their own lands.\nFor this reason, jurists like Ibn Taymiyyah asserted that the Quran and the majority of scholars only authorize warfare against others on the condition that they wage or threaten war first.[8]Â He exempted all categories of people from aggression except for the âpeople of combat and obstruction,â that is, those who attack Muslims or who violently prevent them from practicing their religion. Non-combatants such as women, children, monks, elders, the blind, and others may not be attacked unless theyÂ join the war effort.[9]Â \nThe Prophet ï·ºâsÂ principle of non-aggression not only prevents unjust warsÂ from starting, it also preventsÂ injustice from occurring once war has already been declared. We now turn our attention to how Islam established rules, based upon non-aggression, to minimize the harms of warfare as much as possible.\nJustice in War (Jus in Bello)\nJust as âpersecution is worse than killingâ is the key verse describing what authorizes a just war (jus ad bellum), the following verse highlights the Islamic criteria for justice in war, or how war is properly fought within its rules of engagement:\n\nFight in God&#8217;s cause against those who fight you, but do not overstep the limits: God does not love those who overstep the limits.[10]\n\nThis was the first verse in the Quran commanding Muslims to fight. Prior to this verse and others giving Muslims permission to fight, the Quran âadvised Muslims to be patient against pains inflicted on them by disbelievers, even to ignore and forgive when theyÂ can.â[11]Â However, when it became necessary for Muslims to fight back against aggression, lest they be killed, this verse was revealed commanding the Muslims to go to war. From this verse, many critical Islamic rules of engagement are derived.\nThe first and most important principle is this:Â Fighting is limited to those individuals who fight you, to combatants alone.\nThe verse says explicitly âFight against those who fight you,â and therefore civilians may not be targeted. As Michael Walzer, a preeminent scholar of modern just war theory, argues, the killing of combatantsÂ can only occurÂ when a war has been legally declared.[12]Â Islam complements this argument. Muslim jurists have derived from the above verse that it is impermissible to kill those not engaged in the actual fighting, especially women, children, the elderly, priests, monks, the handicapped, and even laborers or farmers who work for the enemy but are not directly involved in the fighting.[13]\nThis is highlighted by the statement of Abu Bakr, Prophet Muhammad ï·ºâs closest companion, and second-in-command, when he instructed his army as recorded in the earliest manual of Islamic law:\n\nYou will find a people who claim to have totally given themselves to God. Leave them to what they claim to have given themselvesâ¦ Do not kill women or children or an aged, infirm person. Do not cut down fruit-bearing trees. Do not destroy an inhabited place. Do not slaughter sheep or camels except for food. Do not burn bees and do not scatter them. Do not steal from the spoils, and do not be cowardly.[14]\n\nThe Prophet ï·º himself setÂ thisÂ precedent in a number of his actions and directives. On one occasion,Â afterÂ a woman was found to have been killed in the battle, the Prophet ï·º âcondemnedâ the killing of women and children.[15]Â In another narration, the Prophet ï·º explained his condemnation by saying, âShe was not fighting,â demonstrating non-combatant immunity, and he further commanded his companions not to kill workers.[16]Â The message of non-aggression was even written on the Prophet ï·ºâs sword as a reminder to all, âVerily, the worst of people in insolence are those who strike at whoever did not strike them, a man who kills those who did not fight him.â[17]Â There are many narrations and traditions like these that emphasize protecting the lives of civilians and noncombatants.\nIn light of this principle, an additional rule of engagement must be emphasized:Â Transgressing the limits is prohibited.\nOn the battlefield, the old, the weak, women, children, monks, laborers, and other civilians cannot be targeted unless they forfeit that immunity by fighting themselves. Even then, force is authorized only in proportion to the threat, so killing them should be avoided if at all possible.\nTwo more rules outlaw cruelty against combatantsÂ andÂ destruction of property: 1)Â Mutilation and torture are prohibited; and 2)Â Destruction of crops, trees, livestock or civilian infrastructure is not permissible except in certain limited circumstancesÂ (explored later on).\nThese very principles were affirmed by Article 3 of the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights, issued and adopted at the Nineteenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers in Cairo in 1990, which was based on traditionalÂ ShariaÂ (or principles of Islamic Law):\n\na) In the event of the use of force and in case of armed conflict, it is not permissible to kill non-belligerents such as old men, women and children. The wounded and the sick shall have the right to medical treatment; and prisoners of war shall have the right to be fed, sheltered, and clothed. It is prohibited to mutilate dead bodies. It is a duty to exchange prisoners of war and to arrange visits or reunions of the families separated by the circumstances of war.\nb) It is prohibited to fell trees, to damage crops or livestock, and to destroy the enemyâs civilian buildings and installations by shelling, blasting or any other means.[18]\n\nThus, the Quran and Sunnah clearly provide stringent protections for noncombatants during warfare. Civilians may in no way be intentionally targeted. The Quran emphasizes this rule by saying, âDo not transgress, for God does not love transgressors.â In other words, fighting is limited to combatantsâthose who are engaged in fightingâand killing anyone besides them is a prohibited transgression hated by God according to Islamic Law. Unsurprisingly, these rules are consistent with Walzerâs modern theory.\nThe Quran is very clear about the gravity of taking innocent life:\n\nOn account of [his deed], We decreed to the Children of Israel that if anyone kills a personâunless in retribution for murder or spreading corruption in the landâit is as if he kills all mankind, while if any saves a life it is as if he saves the lives of all mankind.[19]\n\nHere, the Quran makes a prohibition and an order simultaneously. It declares that taking an innocent human life is tantamount to mass murder, for approving one murder is to morally approve of every murder. At the same time, the verse makes it permissible for the state to use the death penalty under the strictest of conditions (discussion of which is beyond the scope of this article). Nonetheless, the enormity of killing a single person should give every believer pause if its legality is disputable, as the Prophet ï·º said, âThe most restrained of the people regarding killing are the people of faith.â[20]Â The Quran is also deliberately worded towards protecting all life, includingÂ the lives ofÂ non-Muslims. It does not say, âIf anyone kills a Muslim, it would be as if he killed all mankind.â Rather, the word used in Arabic isÂ nafs, meaning âa soulâ or âa life,â regardless of faith or ethnicity or any other identity trait. The murder of any life is tantamount to mass murder and a crime against humanity (in the literal sense); it is absolutely prohibited in the strongest terms.\nHowever, the Quran clearly makes it permissible to kill combatants during warfare. According to just war theory, as outlined by Walzer, enemy combatants may legitimately be killed at any point, even when they are unarmed, as long as they are not wounded or captured.[21]Â He makes a detailed case that it is legally and morally justified to kill enemy soldiers at any point during warfare and that even when not actively engaged in fighting at the time, designated soldiers do not regain their right to life.\nIn the same vein, the Quran too considers the killing of enemy soldiers during a war to be legitimate, which is the context of the verse, âKill them wherever you encounter them, and drive them out from where they drove you out, for persecution is more serious than killing.â[22]Â This verse was revealed after the signing of the Hudaybiyyah treaty when Muslims were about to embark on a pilgrimage to Mecca. They did not know how to react if they were met with aggression. Were they allowed to fight back against those who attacked them? Were they allowed to take back land and property wrongfully taken from them by force?\nThis verse answered those questions. Namely, that it is permissible to attack and kill the combatants with whom you are at war and also to reclaim wrongfully taken land and property using proportional force. It would be entirely misleading to cite the clause âKill them wherever you find themâ without reference toÂ the surroundingÂ verses or the historical and legal context. Often some non-Muslims and even Muslims misquote this verse to justify their own agendas as if the Quran was inciting wanton violence. However, this verse is very clear when interpreted within its proper context. It defines important limits in warfare. It does not permit the unrestrained killing of people âwherever you find them.â\nThe Quran ends this verse by saying âthis is what such disbelievers deserve,â referring to the idolaters who attacked the Muslims in Mecca. It should be noted that this clauseÂ doesÂ not makeÂ it permissible to kill non-Muslims simply because of their non-belief in Islam, as the previous verse only permitted attacking those who attacked first. Noncombatant men, women, children, elderly and so on were never targeted by Prophet Muhammad ï·ºâs army. In fact, Mecca was eventually liberated from the oppressive Quraish aristocracy and not a single drop of blood was shed, despite the fact that many of the idolaters who had persecuted Muslims for years were now vulnerable. They were all pardoned except for a few of the worst war criminals.[23]\nFinally, the relevant passage ends with the following mitigating qualifications:\n\nBut if they stop, then God is most forgiving and merciful. Fight them until there is no more persecution, and worship is devoted to God. If they cease hostilities, there can be no [further] hostility, except towards aggressors. A sacred month for a sacred month: violation of sanctity [calls for] fair retribution. So if anyone commits aggression against you, attack him as he attacked you, but be mindful of God, and know that He is with those who are mindful of Him.[24]\n\nA concise picture of just war theory comes into focus. The passage reiterates the reason for fighting: toÂ bring an end toÂ aggression and oppression. That âworship is devoted to Godâ means that Godâs law of justice is upheld and the natural rights of all are protected. It does not require people to actually embrace Islam individually, but only that they uphold social justice consistent with Islamic and humanitarian values.\nMoreover, if enemies desist in their fighting, such as when a soldier surrenders or a state calls for a peace treaty, then their peace offering should be accepted without any retribution (except for individuals guilty of war crimes). As the Quran states elsewhere, âBut if they incline towards peace, you [Prophet] must also incline towards it, and put your trust in God.â[25]Â Even individual combatants must be granted asylum if they request it, âIf any of the idolaters should seek your protection [Prophet], grant it to him so that he may hear the word of God, then take him to a place safe for him, for they are people with no knowledge [of it].â[26]\nThe Quran emphasizes that peace should be made with the enemy, regardless of their faith or race or any other characteristic of their identity. Peace is always preferred as long as the enemy inclines towards it and quits its aggression. At that point, there is no authorization for hostility except against those who continue their aggression orÂ whoÂ have committed war crimes. Furthermore, if an enemy combatant seeks refuge, Muslims are ordered to grant him it.\nThat being said, we can affirm the following rules of engagement:\n\nWar is allowed only to end aggression or persecution.\nPeace offerings should be accepted on their face.\nEnemy soldiers who surrender should not be harmed.\n\nNow that the basic foundation of just war has been established, we will move on to discuss its details.\nPrisoners of War (POWs)\nAs proven earlier, enemies who surrender or stop fighting must be given safety. The Quran declares that giving charity to prisoners of war is on par with feeding the poor and needy, saying of the believers, âThey give food to the poor, the orphan, and the captive, though they love it themselves.â[27]Â According to the earliest exegete Al-á¹¬abari, the âcaptiveâ in this verse is âthe combatant from the land of war who has been taken by force in victoryâ¦ Thus, God praised these righteous people for their feeding of these [prisoners], seeking closeness to God and His pleasure by that, and their mercy for them.â[28]Â In other words, theÂ earlyÂ believers gave up their own food, which they desired, to the same prisoners who had previously been attacking them.\nIslam prescribed an ingenious solution to the dilemma of what to do with prisoners of war. This dilemma has troubled states since the dawn of time and continues to cause moral predicaments in the modern world,Â as seen inÂ the military prisons of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. Walzer addresses this issue, writing:\n\nA soldier who surrenders enters into an agreement with his captors: he will stop fighting if they will accord him what the legal handbooks call âbenevolent quarantineââ¦ Prisoners of war have the right to try to escapeâthey cannot be punished for the attemptâbut if they kill a guard in order to escape, the killing is not an act of war; it is murder. For they committed themselves to stop fighting,Â gaveÂ up their right to kill, when they surrendered.[29]Â \n\nWhile this sounds ideal,Â itÂ is vague and rarely put into true practice today. What exactly constitutes âbenevolent quarantineâ? How long should prisoners be imprisoned? How can they attain their freedom?\nThroughout history there have been a few standard optionsÂ regarding the treatment ofÂ prisoners of war:\nExecuteÂ ThemÂ \nPlain and simple, and perhaps the quickest and easiest solution for captors. This, of course, is morally reprehensible except as a legal punishment for bona fide war criminals. Execution as a general prescription is against both Islamic and modern just war principles.\nImprisonÂ ThemÂ \nThis action is compatible with Islam and just war theory on the condition that prisoners are not mistreated. The disadvantage of this system, even when instituted appropriately, is that it hurts both the captives and captors. For the captives, it forces them to be locked up indefinitely, where they can neither benefit themselves nor society. For their captors, it imposes hardship on their society as they must pay for the prisonerâs shelter, food, medical treatment, and guards, among other things. Logistically, without the resources to construct mass systems of incarceration with appropriately staffed and furnished buildings, this would have been impossible to implement in the aftermath of a large battle. In historical practice, it has been rare that prisoners were held in ideal conditions. TheyÂ were oftenÂ subject to inhumane treatment with no clear end in sight but escape or execution.\nReleaseÂ ThemÂ \nThis is the most generous solution, but it is entirely impractical and can even be dangerous. If your enemies know that they will merely be released whenever they are captured, they know that they can later regroup and attack you again.\nSince none of these solutions are morallyÂ or practicallyÂ viable as a general rule, Islam took an existing practice and humanized, transformed, and reformed it: the system ofÂ ruq, or bondage, sometimes incorrectly equated with chattel slavery. Each prisoner was assigned to one household of the Muslim community. That household was responsible for providing the bondsman with adequate shelter and the same quality of food and clothing shared by all members of the family. The bondsman, in turn, would assist the family with routine chores and labor. This relationship would continue until the bondsman was ransomed by his own community, he was freed by his caretaker, orÂ he bought his own freedom. In this way, the prisoner made use of his time and benefited himself and society without being mistreated or being aÂ burdenÂ on society. In addition, the requirement for monetary payment to be freed servedÂ as a deterrent to enemies.\nThe Islamic system certainly qualifies as âbenevolent quarantineâ in modern just war theory. The prisoner is protected from abuse and given the same quality treatment and living standards as the household master he is assigned to live with. The prisoner is also is able to pay back this good treatment with his labor, so as not to disadvantage the community.\nIn order to ensure the objectives of this system, the Prophet ï·ºÂ imposed several rules and restrictions on bondage. The caretaker could not change the name of his bondsman and thereby do violence to his family lineage. The bondsmanÂ needed toÂ be given the opportunity to work towards purchasing their own freedom, as the Quran states, âIf any of your bondsmen wish to pay for their freedom, make a contract with them accordingly.â[30]Â The bondsmanÂ had toÂ be treated as an equal, his natural rights respected, and not be burdened with too much work. One of the companions, Abu Dharr, was seen wearing the same clothing as his bondsman. When he was asked why, he said that the Prophet ï·º once censured him for abusing his bondsman, saying:\n\nThey are your brothers and sisters. God has placed them in your hands. Whoever has his brother under him should feed him with the same food he eats, clothe him with the same clothes he wears, and not burden him beyond his ability. If you burden him, then help him.[31]\n\nFreeing bondsmen is also greatly rewarded by God and is even required for the expiation of many sins. The Quran describes the path to salvation as âto free a bondsman.â[32]Â The Prophet ï·º encouraged freeing captives in general, whenever possible, saying, âFeed the hungry, visit the sick, and set the captives free.â[33]Â He also made it a rule that simply slapping a bondsman or servant in a humiliating way necessitated their freedom, âWhoever strikes his bondsman without limit or slaps him, then the expiation for the sin is to emancipate him.â[34]\nAs can be seen from the above restrictions, the system of bondage in Islam was designed to integrate prisoners of war as productive members of society. Sometimes bondsmen would convert to Islam when receiving such graceful treatment. The sign of Islamâs truth is the fact that so many of its former enemies, like Umar ibn Al-Khattab and Abu Sufyan, eventually came to accept it willingly.\nThe bondage system was so successful in many cases that entire classes of bondsmen or their children achieved high social status and even became rulers in the Muslim world, such as the Mamluks (âthose who were ownedâ) in the Ottoman Empire. This system, unfortunately, has been unfairly characterized as equivalent to how Native Americans and Africans were treated by their European and American slave masters. These slaves were usually given no or little rights, mistreated,Â ruthlesslyÂ beaten, and sometimes killed.Â But the similarity between âslaveryâ in Islam and the European/American slavery system is only in the name people have given to it.[35]Â Bondsmen under Islamic law were under control for completely different reasons, as prisoners of war rather than because of their race. Prisoners in Islam were treated far better and givenÂ the opportunityÂ for upwardÂ social mobility. Furthermore, as mentioned, Islam encouraged and facilitated the freeing of bondsmen.\nThe Islamic system, in fact, can be a fair and benevolent alternative to the treatment of prisoners in modern times. It could be argued that the Western standard for how prisoners of war are treatedâas seen at Guantanamo Bay and other âblack sitesââis in reality much less humane than the traditional IslamicÂ system.\nDouble Effect\nIn war, sometimes military actions must be taken that will invariably take civilian lives and destroy property. Can such actions be considered just?\nThe doctrine of âdouble effectâ takes into consideration that any military action might have two elements, a positive effect and a negative effect, with the positive effect being what is intended. A negative effect can be justified as the lesser of two evils. Walzer asserts that this doctrine is the basis for accepting a reasonable degree of collateral damage:\n\n[I]t is permissible to perform an act likely to have evil consequences (like the killing of noncombatants) provided the following four conditions hold: 1) The act is good in itself or at least indifferent, which means, for our purposes that it is a legitimate act of war. 2) The direct effect is morally acceptableâthe destruction of military supplies, for example, or the killing of enemy soldiers. 3) The intention of the actor is good, that is, he aims only at the acceptable effect; the evil effect is not one of his ends, nor is it a means to his ends. 4) The good effect is sufficiently good to compensate for allowing the evil effect; it must be justifiable under Sidgwickâs proportionality rule.[36]\n\nIn other words, Walzer argues that it is just and acceptable to take military actions that may have harmful unintended consequences, like the deaths of civilians, as long as the initial act is legitimate and the positive outcome (repelling a threat) is the primary motive. The evil consequence must not be the purpose and aim of the action and, importantly, the evil effects must be sufficiently outweighed by the positive outcome(s)Â of the action.\nThis understanding is consistent with Islamic law principles that allow a greater harm to be removed by a lesser harm, to attempt to calculate as much as possible the net benefit and harm of an action. As a rule, it was clear that the Prophet ï·º absolutely forbade the intentional targeting and killing of civilians in all circumstances, particularly women and children. Even so, due to the generally accepted principle of military necessity and choosing the lesser of two evils, as limited by the four conditions of double effect, the Prophet ï·º conceded to the permissibility of taking military action when it might result in harm to civilians, but only if such actions were necessary and unavoidable.\nThe condition remained that civiliansÂ couldÂ not be targeted purposefully, but legitimate military actions realistically expected to result in collateral damage need not be prohibited altogether. Of course, this does not justify direct attacks against civilians or any action that is likely to cause disproportionate harm. This understanding was expressed by Imam Muslim in a chapter of his entitled, âPermissibility of killing women and children in night raids if it is not deliberate.â He cites an incident in which the Prophet ï·º conducted a night raid against the enemy and some women and children were found later to have been killed accidentally. The Prophet ï·º was asked about them and he said, âThey are from them.â[37]Â ItÂ was consideredÂ the fault of the enemy for putting their civilians in proximity to a legitimate military target.\nThis incident established the principle of military necessity in Islam, as limited by the conditions of double effect. Though the killing of noncombatants isÂ terriblyÂ reprehensible, it may at times be unavoidable while taking action to push back against the enemyâs aggression. If the prohibition of killing civilians was absolute in each and every circumstance, even when unavoidable and unintended, it would essentially allow the enemy to use human shields to advance their campaign. No reasonable military leader would accept such a disadvantage. To be clear, this concession may not be stretched to the point of directly targeting civilians or causing disproportionate destruction. Islam and just war theory do not allow the concept of the âgreater goodâ to be manipulated for demonstrably evil results.\nUnder the same principle of military necessity and double effect, Islam generally prohibits the destruction of enemy fields, farms, and infrastructure, as mentioned by the command of Abu Bakr cited previously. However, this rule too is subject to the principle of double effect. The Quran permitted the burning of enemy trees if necessary, yet at the same time did not obligate or recommend such tactics, âWhatever you may have done to [their] palm treesâcutting them down or leaving them standing on their rootsâwas done by God&#8217;s leave, so that He might disgrace those who defied Him.â[38]\nThis verse revealed regarding a specific Jewish tribe in Medina, Banu Nadir, who had betrayed the Muslims in violation of the Medina Charter by aiding the Qurayshâs war efforts. It was not an attack on them simply because they were Jewish. During the attack, it was suggested that their palm trees, which offered Banu Nadir protection and resources to continue fighting, should be burnt down. The Muslims disagreed over whether this action should be taken, but the verse validated an attack on their palm trees. It was an action that was normally prohibited, but which became lawful due to necessity.\nAs a result of this verse, the Muslim scholar Shaykh Ibn Humam rules that attacking enemy plant life and infrastructure is legitimate during war âonly if the enemy cannot be vanquished or overpowered without resorting to the above measures.â[39]Â Once again, a normally prohibited action is only allowed as a concession to military necessity. The concession is not something good in itself, rather it is only made permissible when the only alternative is worse.\nThe unlawful expansion of such concessions, to the point of intentionally causing wanton death and destruction, is the essence of terrorism to which we now turn our attention.\nTerrorism\nTerrorism has been defined as the âthe unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.â[40]Â Any form of terrorism, or violation of non-aggression principles, is an entirely illegitimate war crime in both Islamic law and modern just war theory, for all of the reasons we have outlined up to this point.\nÂ Sometimes, regrettably, the Quran is translated in a manner that seems to encourage terror, such as the verse: âPrepare whatever forces you [believers] can muster, including warhorses, to frighten off God&#8217;s enemies and yours, and warn others unknown to you but known to God.â[41]Â The context is evident that the purpose is not to frighten whole societies or intimidate people towards some self-serving political goal, but instead to deter potential threats. The âfearâ or âterrorâ is not generated from an actual attack, especially not an attack on civilians or their property. The purpose isÂ deterrence,Â not terror. Moreover, immediately following this verse is the command to accept peace, as previously cited, which lets us know that such deterrence only applies to enemy aggressors.\nDeterrence is another legitimate action in just war theory. According to political scientists Frank Zagare and D. Marc Kilgour, successful deterrence to avoid war requires not only capabilityÂ but also credibility within âthe norm of reciprocity.â[42]Â When a state has both the capability and credibility to carry out a threat or respond to an attack, war is less likely to break out. A state that attacks another state should expect a counter-attack. During the Cold War, it was the doctrine of mutually-assured destruction or âthe balance of power,â rooted in reciprocal deterrence, that prevented the Soviet Union and the United States from unleashing a global nuclear holocaust. In order to preserve the peace, the Quran advocates for building up military preparation as a deterrent against possible threats. This is the context in which âterrorâ is used in the Quran, even thoughÂ the term usedÂ could be translated differently to avoid this undue connotation. The Quran in no way justifies the intentional killing of innocent civilians, or âterrorismâ as understood today. Even Bernard Lewis, a scholar known to be highly critical of Muslims, admits as much, âAt no point do the basic texts of Islam enjoin terrorism and murder.â[43]\nAs the serious academic study of terrorism has shown, the alleged relationship between Islam and terrorism is spurious at best and dangerous at worst. Political scientist Robert Pape studied suicide terrorist attacks committed by Muslim extremists (or deviants, a more accurate description) and found that Islam itself was not the motivation:\n\nThe data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any one of the worldâs religionsâ¦ Rather, what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common is a specific secular and strategic goal: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from territory that terrorists consider to be their homeland. Religion is rarely the root cause, although it is often used as a tool by terrorist organizations in recruiting and in other efforts in service of the broader strategic objective.[44]\n\nPape also warns about the dangers of policies that assume Islam to be the root cause of terrorism, ââ¦the presumed connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism is misleading and may be encouraging domestic and foreign policies likely to worsen Americaâs situation and to harm many Muslims needlessly.â[45]Â Muslims and non-Muslims are both being hurt by an erroneous political discourse that blames Islam, and nothing else, for terrorism.\nJoseph Schwartz, another political scientist, writes that even the horrendous attacks of 9/11 had little to do with the Islamic faith and everything to do with resistance to American foreign policy in the Middle East (expressed using illegitimate means):\n\nBut such movements are not simply the creation of warped, irrational minds. Terrorist rage, no matter how ineffective, often arises from totally comprehensible political grievances. To treat Al-Qaeda as an irrationalist cult of slaughter is to ignore the potential rational logic behind its attack on the World Trade Center, a logic that the United States played into by subsequently attacking Afghanistan.[46]\n\nMany real political grievances can motivate terrorists: U.S. support for Israelâs brutal occupation of Palestine, the U.S. invasion and destruction of Iraq, the sanctions preceding the Iraq war that killed as many as half a million people, the ongoing U.S. support for repressive governments, and so on. While none of these grievances justify terrorism in any way, they nonetheless provide the oxygen that is fueling attacks against the U.S. and its allies. Explaining to these terrorists that Islam condemns their methods is ineffective because Islam is not their motivation, despite what their propaganda says. While Muslim scholars can continue to make the obvious case against terrorism in the name of Islam, a three-pronged approach to challenging terrorism is needed: a sustained effort to advocate for humanitarian policy reforms in the Muslim world; challenging failed and unjust U.S policies and actions that create fertile grounds for terrorist recruitment; alongside a continued delegitimization campaign against the warped criminal enterprises that recruit vulnerable individuals to engage in indiscriminate violence for the advancement of said enterprises in the name various causes they hijack.\nConclusion\nThe texts of the Quran and Sunnah make clear that waging war is only permissible as a response to aggression and persecution, to prevent a greater evil. Islam adheres to the non-aggression principle, that no person or animal should be harmed unless such harm is necessary to secure a greater benefit or to prevent a greater harm. On this basis, the Quran mandates military intervention to assist the oppressed, preemptively if required. Islam strictly prohibits the intentional targeting and killing of any civilians or noncombatants or destroying their property, unless a careful military calculus determines that the risk of collateral damage is morally acceptable. Prisoners of war are to be treated humanely, integrated into the wider society, and given realistic avenues to secure their freedom through a reasonable expectation of labor. Deterrence against the enemy, by telegraphing a credible response capability to unprovoked hostility, is encouraged as a means of keeping the peace. Terrorism, by contrast, is a reprehensible tactic that is a violation of both fundamental Islamic teachings and modern just war theory.\n\n\n[1]Â Ibn MÄjah.Â Sunan Ibn MÄjah.

These three phenomena represent fundamental components of the human experience. They are also deeply connected to the Islamic message of self-purification (tazkiyyat an-nafsÂ orÂ tasawwuf). This process is described as the pinnacle of success in the Quran: âCertainly, the one who purifies [oneâs soul] has succeededâ;[1]Â and, âThe one who purifies it has certainly succeeded.â[2]\nIslam represents a system meant to transform an individualâs cognitions, emotions, and behaviors that will ultimately lead them to a meaningful and fulfilling life. Thus, classical scholars who dedicated significant portions of their scholarship to the topic of self-purification consequently developed profound theories of human psychology. In a previous article exploring Islamic Spirituality and Mental Well-Being,[3]Â we concluded that there was a need to construct models of human psychology based on the terminology found in the Quran, building from the Islamic tradition. Such an endeavor will be clinically relevant, providing practitioners with appropriate spiritual paradigms for Muslim clients experiencing mental illness. Furthermore, developing an Islamic framework of psychology will showcase the breadth and depth that exists in the Islamic tradition regarding human psychology and spirituality, enabling others to appreciate their profundity and the value they bring to humanity in the 21st century. Â \nThis article series attempts to build an Islamic model of spiritual psychology that encompasses human cognition, metacognition, consciousness, motivation, emotion, and behavior with an emphasis on practical implications for psycho-spiritual growth and building conviction. Due to the risk of reading modern psychological discourse into the Islamic tradition, we will use Quranic vocabulary and terminology found in the classical sources as the starting point for our discussion. Subsequently, we will compare and contrast with modern insights, either integrating or differentiating to produce a clearer understanding for the 21st-century reader.\nThe articles are organized according to theÂ Maraatib al-QasdÂ (degrees of motivation) model often mentioned in the Islamic tradition.[4]Â This model provides a holistic framework for human behavior that starts with thoughts, proceeds to motivation, and ends with action. The 5-step sequence is described below:\n\nAl-Haajis: A fleeting thought that is quick to enter into consciousness and quick to exit;\nAl-Khaatir: A thought that enters into the mind and an individual chooses to think about;\nHadith an-Nafs: An internal conversation, where a thought is deliberated over in depth;\nAl-Hamm: A motivation to act, where a thought process has impacted a personâs motivation or emotional state; and\nAl-âAzm: A firm resolve to execute an action. While a person may still hesitate over aÂ hamm, once they reach the point ofÂ âazmÂ it has become a firm decision with no going back.[5]Â \n\nThe current article focuses on the first three stages. It examines the emergence of conscious thought and the various types of deliberation referenced in the Quran. Section 1 focuses on the significance of thoughts; Section 2 explores the fundamentals of thought; Section 3 describes the concepts of metacognition and contemplation; and Section 4 showcases a practical contemplative practice for moral and spiritual growth developed by the famous polymath Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751 AH). Â \nSection 1: Significance of Thoughts\nOur thoughts are the deepest interface we have with the dimension of the spirit.Â This is because our thoughts exist beyond the physical world. Although we can observe when a person is engaged in thought, we can never physically observe the actual content of the thought. Other than Allah, no one can know our thoughts as we experience them. Thoughts, in their essence, carry meaning and content. Thus, although electroencephalography (EEG) can measure the neuronal activity associated with thinking, we will never be able to observe its essential content. From this perspective, thinking is a metaphysical process that carries us beyond the confines of the material world. Thoughts themselves are otherworldly in the sense that their content is not made up of particles or atoms.\nIt is no wonder that the Quran heavily emphasizes the spiritual action of engaging in thought. In over 750 places, the Quran directs the human being to think, ponder, reflect, listen, and observe.[6]Â The common element among all these processes is the conscious thought that is produced in the mind. It is a tragedy that most have lost touch with the rich experience that exists in the mind. Despite the progress in knowledge and technology witnessed in the 21st century, the world has reacted to it counterproductively, and the mind has gone from center to backstage.\nAge of Distraction\nIn the modern age of rapidly advancing technology, considerable time is invested in learning how to utilize the latest digital systems to boost productivity in all dimensions of our lives. In our careers, employers place high value on technological proficiency. Those who fail to keep up with the constant onslaught of digital tidal waves become uncompetitive in the ever-shrinking job market that is shifting towards integrating new systems to increase workplace efficiency. Our social lives have also been transformed with innovations in social media and networking tools that have removed nearly all barriers to communicating with friends and family. Our minds are constantly distracted with all the new devices that we own as we struggle to keep up with the seemingly never-ending series of updates and changes.\nAlex Pang, the author ofÂ The distraction addiction, describes our online lives as actual jobs: âIf maintaining your online life feels like a job, maybe thatâs because it is.â[7]Â He explains that the average American spends 60 hours a month online. Those hours add up to 3 months of full-time work per year. In this âonline career,â we spend 20 days on social networking websites, 38 days on blogs, YouTube and news websites, and 32 days purely on email. When looking at the usage of devices in just one day, we find that the average American sends and receives 110 messages, checks their phone 34 times, visits Facebook on 5 separate occasions, and spends 30 minutes total liking posts.[8]Â \nConstant engagement with technology, screens, and devices not only paradoxically hinders our productivity in reaching our goals, but also has significant effects on the mind. Clark and Â Chalmers, philosophers of consciousness, advanced a theory of the extended mind in 1998 that has become better understood in light of recent inventions.[9]Â The theory states that human beings often utilize devices in the external environment for cognitive processes that would normally occur intra-mentally. The clearest example of this is memory. In the past, notebooks were used and in our times, it has become applications on our phones, laptops, tablets, and computers that allow us to offload even more of our memory than in the past due to the ease of accessibility and efficiency of storage in new technology. The classic example is the shift in memorizing phone numbers. KasperSky Lab conducted a survey in Europe and found that 60% of adults were able to recall the phone number of the home they lived in when they were 10 years old, but could not recall the current phone numbers of their children or office. One third of the participants were unable to recall the number of their partners.[10]Â We used to register important phone numbers in the memory system of our mind, but have now outsourced this process extra-mentally.\nMind extension is not limited to memory, but also includes executive functions such as planning. Google automatically sends you a message with suggested times to leave home to catch a flight. There are even applications that cross-reference your pre-selected food preferences with restaurant menus to suggest the most appropriate food selections.\nDue to this unprecedented level of outsourcing ofÂ the mind, we have lost the hidden treasure that lies within its use. Being preoccupied with gadgets, screens, and devices has distracted us from the powerful creativity, insight, and self-awareness that our minds were designed for. Modern science has recognized the utility and potential that lies in the depths of our minds and souls. In particular, there have been many studies conducted on the meditation practices of far Eastern traditions. These practices have Â been found to have profound positive effects on emotional, psychological, and physical disorders including depression, substance abuse, alcohol abuse, and cardiovascular disease such as hypertension.[11]Â At a more fundamental level, thoughts have been demonstrated scientifically to have profound effects on our biological functioning. A common phenomenon known as the âplacebo effect,â a therapeutic benefit that is achieved solely through a personâs belief that they will heal, is a profound example of thoughts impacting our health.[12]Â The findings regarding the placebo effect suggest that it is ubiquitous and can be effective against various pathophysiological and psychopathological states. Conversely, it is well established that stress, which is partly based on the cognitive framing of our life circumstances, has significant negative effects on a wide variety of biological systems including hormone regulation, cardiovascular disease, and immune system functioning.\nSection 2: Fundamentals of Thought\nKhawaatir\nThe thoughts that flood our minds during our waking moments are collectively termedÂ khawaatirÂ by Ibn al-Qayyim (subsuming the categories ofÂ haajisÂ andÂ hadith al-nafsÂ defined earlier).[13]Â Dr. Maalik el-Badri, a contemporary Muslim psychologist, definesÂ khawaatirÂ as âinternal dialogueâ or âconcealed speechâ that may occur fleetingly.[14]Â These are the thoughts in the constant running dialogue that represents the lens of our lived reality.Â KhawaatirÂ seem to be analogous in this respect to the âautomatic thoughtsâ described by Aaron Beck, the founder of cognitive therapy.[15]Â Automatic thoughts refer to mental activity that emerges without conscious effort in response to a stimulus. One component that seems to be associated with the content of ourÂ khawaatirÂ is our innate personality.[16]Â KhawaatirÂ from an Islamic perspective can be conceptualized as the amalgamation of competing forces from our unconscious. These forces exist internally as a part of us orÂ externally as separate agents (Divine, angelic, or satanic).\nTheÂ Unconscious\nThe topic of the unconscious is very complex and has been approached through both cognitive and psychodynamic perspectives in the field of psychology. Freud was one of the first Western intellectuals to discuss the influence of the unconscious (or subconscious) on conscious thoughts, motivations, desires, and dreams. It is interesting to note that some of Freudâs ideas regarding defense mechanisms of the unconscious were predated significantly by Muslim theologians.Â For instance, Ibn Hazm (d. 456 AH) described repression of forbidden sexual impulses towards family members as resulting in a variety of conscious behaviors.[17]\nAlthough Freudâs understanding of the unconscious focused primarily on aggression and sexuality, his protÃ©gÃ© Carl Jung espoused his own theory of the unconscious that incorporated complex religious belief systems into what he termed the âcollective unconscious.â Both psychologists attempted to discover the common unconscious psychological architecture present in every human being. This dimension of the human mind is not a material entity, rendering its study beyond the empirical limitations of Â the scientific method. Hence, it has not been given much attention beyond these two figures in the western world. Recently, however, cognitive and social psychologists have explored the role of unconscious bias in determining attitudes, beliefs, and prejudices. The focus has shifted from describing the structural components of the unconscious, to describing its functional implications.\nAs mentioned, the unconscious is the dimension of the human being that is fundamentally part of the realm of theÂ ghaybÂ (unseen). Thus, it behooves any Muslim seeking to achieve a better understanding of the mind to explore the perspective of revelation. At least one prophetic narration affirms the notion that an unconscious part of the mind can influence our conscious thoughts and drives,\n\nAbu Huraira reports that the Prophet ï·º said, âCertainly, Allah has overlooked for my ummah what arises (haddathat) in his mind (nafs) as long as he does not act it out or vocalize it.â[18]\n\nAccountability exclusively applies to phenomena that are within the boundary of our conscious choices. The Quran informs us,\n\nÂ God does not place a burden on a person that he is not capable of fulfilling.[19]\n\nThus, we are not held accountable for any mental phenomena that are outside the reach of our will. ThisÂ hadithÂ implies that there is an underlying unconscious structure that determines certain conscious thoughts outside of our will. We will explore the unconscious structure implied in theÂ hadithÂ and shed light on its various components.\nComponents of the Unconscious\nWaswaas\nOne of the most significant influences on our consciousness is termedÂ waswaasÂ (whispering).[20]Â The Islamic tradition speaks about this phenomenon in context of (1) satanic whispering, (2) self-whispering, and (3) angelic whispering.\nSatanic Whispering\nSatanic whispering is further divided into evil suggestions from the unseen and the seen realm. Both of these categories of satanic whispering are referenced in the last chapter of the Quran,\n\nSay: I seek refuge in the Master of Humanity, the King of Humanity, the God of Humanity from the evil whispering of the one who retreats. He who whispers into the chests of Humanity from among the Jinn (hidden creatures) and Humanity.[21]Â \n\nIt is clear that JinniÂ waswaasÂ would be considered in the domain of the unconscious, but what is humanÂ waswaasÂ and how is it considered unconscious? HumanÂ waswaasÂ encompasses any communication from human beings that can be extended beyond direct conversations to include books, media, and images. Although the initial suggestion by other human beings is in the domain of consciousness, it later becomes unconscious when it is incorporated into our memory systems. These suggestions can stir emotions and desires within us at any moment in which we encounter anything relevant in our life. Ibn al-Qayyim writes, âNext, thinking will be transferred to or stored in the memory and the memory will transform it into a volition and a motive which will be acted out in real life as an action.â[22]\nThus, external agents can determine the makeup of our unconscious that will inevitably affect our conscious thoughts. Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 597 AH) provides a vivid conceptualization of how these external agents gain access to our unconscious,\n\nIblis enters into the human being according to the space that is available for him. The space is increased based on the level of heedlessness, ignorance, or lack of knowledge. Realize that the heart is like a fortress with walls. In these walls are gates. Through these gates is the potential for the fortress to be breached. The intellect dwells inside this fortress and the angels encircle it. To the side of this fortress is the place for the desires. The devils gain access to this area without any difficulty. Thus begins the war between the fortress and those outside. Shaytaan constantly searches for an opening into the fortress where a personâs guard is let down so he can breach the wall.[23]\n\nThe domain ofÂ waswaasÂ in the unconscious can be tempered through conscious interventions. It is possible that through breaking free ofÂ distractions and attaining knowledge and consciousness of GodÂ a person can transform the entire dynamic of the unconscious. This struggle between the individual and Satan is a key dimension of the unconscious and the conscious that Ibn al-Qayyim also speaks about. He explains that every day the self enters the battlefield,\n\nHe puts on his army gear and takes his weapons as he enters into the battlefield. His desires and passions against his intellect (âaql) and guidance (huda). The only way to victory is through the help of Allah.[24]\n\nShaytaan uses the individualâs own passions and desires as weapons against the person. If he is overcome, then\n\nhis intellect is with shaytaan like a prisoner in the hand of the enemyâ¦the very thing that Allah has honored and elevated his status with comes in the possession of his enemy and is used to destroy him.[25]\n\nWhispers of theÂ NafsÂ (Self)\nTheÂ waswaasÂ that emerges from theÂ nafsÂ is referenced in the Quran,\n\nAnd We have certainly created man and know what his nafs whispers to himâ¦[26]\n\nThe content of the whispers of theÂ nafsÂ is determined by interactions between a personâs desires, guidance, and character. The unrestricted human desire seeks that which brings it pleasure. Ibn al-Qayyim categorized pleasure into three types corresponding to three general desires. The first type of pleasure includes those rooted in attaining necessities for survival and propagation such as eating, drinking, and procreation. The second type of pleasure concerns climbing the dominance hierarchy to attain authority and leadership. The final category of pleasure is experienced through awareness of God and developing virtue.[27]Â None of the categories represent purely sinful desires. Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 728 AH) describes the basis of pleasure, âExperiencing what is compatible with oneâs self is the means of pleasure.â[28]Â Thus, our desire for pleasure is positive from this perspective. However, the Quran describes following desires as a negative quality that hinders growth of the individual:\n\nThey are the ones who Allah has placed a seal over their hearts and they follow their desires.[29]\nThey only follow conjecture and what the self desires even though guidance has come to them from their Lord.[30]\n\nIbn al-Qayyim distinguishes blameworthy pleasures from praiseworthy pleasures by focusing on theirÂ ultimate outcomes. He explains that pleasure that eventually leads to pain is blameworthy.[31]Â Thus, overindulging in desires or oppressing others to achieve pleasure will eventually lead to pain in this life and in the next. The true pursuit of eternal pleasure can only be found in a meaningful and fulfilling relationship with the Divine.\nTheÂ nafsÂ can motivate towards good or evil depending on its integration with the positive elements of human nature such asÂ aqlÂ (intellect) andÂ hudaÂ (guidance) or negative elements such asÂ hawaaÂ (desires) andÂ waswaasÂ (evil whispers). The Quran categorizes the levels ofÂ nufoosÂ into three:\nLevel 1:Â Nafs Ammara bis-Sooâ\nâCertainly theÂ nafsÂ commands towards evil except for those whom Allah has shown Mercy.â[32]\nLevel 2:Â Nafs Lawwama\nâI swear by theÂ nafsÂ that feelsÂ guilty.â[33]\nLevel 3:Â Nafs Mutmaâinna\nâO tranquilÂ nafs, return to your Lord well-pleased and pleasing toÂ Him.â[34]Â \nThe thoughts that emerge from theÂ nafsÂ are in accordance with where it falls in the spectrum. ThoseÂ nufoosÂ that are underdeveloped are susceptible to influences from evilÂ waswaasÂ and more likely to overindulge in natural desires. TheÂ nufoosÂ that are developed will use revelation and their intellect to curb their desires and overcome satanic whispers.\nPart 2 of this article will, GodÂ Willing, provide a more detailed exposition on theÂ nafsÂ and its role in constructing our motivations, emotions, and thoughts.\nWhispers from Angels\nAbdullahÂ ibn Masâud reports that the Prophet ï·º said, âThere is none among you except that he has one partner from the jinn and another from the angels.â[35]\nThe angelic whispers are inclinations toward goodness that are inspired into the hearts of mankind as described in another narration,\n\nAbdullah reports that the Prophet ï·º said, âSatan has a portion over the son of Adam and the angel has a share over him. The devil directs man to commit evil actions and deny the truth and the angel encourages man to do good actions and believe in the truth.â[36]\n\nIlhaamÂ (Inspiration) andÂ FiraasaÂ (Intuition)\nIlhamÂ refers to direct inspiration from God. A famous example of this phenomenon is found in the story of Moses and his mother,\n\nAnd we inspired to the mother of Moses, âSuckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him one of the messengers.â[37]\n\nInspiration is often experienced as intuition and is referred to asÂ firaasa. The Prophet ï·º describedÂ firaasaÂ as a light from God,\nâBeware theÂ firaasaÂ (spiritual intuition) of the believer, for he sees with the light of Allah.â[38]\nThe concept ofÂ firaasaÂ is also alluded to in the Quran,\nâCertainly in that (story of Lot) are signs for theÂ mutawassimeenÂ (those who discern).â[39]\nIbn Abbas and other commentators of the Quran noted thatÂ mutawassimeenÂ here refers to theÂ mutafarriseen, those who possessÂ firaasa.[40]\nIbn al-Qayyim illuminates the link betweenÂ firaasaÂ and the story of Lot by explaining, ââ¦When a person observes the outcomes of previous transgressing nations, then he is grantedÂ firaasaâ¦â[41]\nIbn al-Qayyim definesÂ firaasaÂ as âlight that Allah throws into the heart of a believer that allows him to distinguish between truth and falsehood.â[42]Â He also quotes other scholars that describe the dimension ofÂ firaasaÂ that relates to attaining knowledge of unseen realities.[43]Â He further explains that phenomenologicallyÂ firaasaÂ is experienced as a belief, thought, or idea that emerges into oneâs consciousness that obliterates anything that opposes it. One way to distinguishÂ firaasaÂ from other thoughts is that âfiraasaÂ is the first thought that emerges without any oppositional thoughts that co-occur alongside. If oppositional thoughts co-occur then this is regarded as a normal thought.â[44]\nFiraasaÂ can include predictions of the futureÂ as well asÂ judgments regarding people that arenât empirically verifiable or readily observable. The latter concept is elucidated in a story regarding Junayd al-Baghdadi:Â \n\nOnce Junayd was delivering a public lecture and a young Christian boy disguised as a Muslim came to ask a question. He said, âO Shaykh, what is the meaning of the saying of the prophet, âBeware of the intuition of the believer, for he sees with the light of Allah.ââ[45]Â Junayd was silent and then raised his head to him and said, âBecome Muslim, the time of your Islam has come.â The young boy immediately became Muslim.[46]\n\nIbn al-Qayyim also describes types ofÂ firaasaÂ that are not related to faith and are accessible to all human beings based on other important characteristics. For example, he explains that doctors of medicine possess a type ofÂ firaasaÂ based on their knowledge and experience.[47]Â There are also people who are not Muslims who are able to interpret dreams based on their capacity for interpretingÂ symbols.[48]Â He also explains thatÂ scientific theoryÂ can be useful in deriving accurate predictions. He explains this as ânatural intuitionâ (al-firaasa al-khalqiyyah) based on the connection between natural events.[49]Â Ibn al-Qayyim notes that these types of intuitions do not aid a person in understanding deeper truths that will bring them benefit in both worlds.[50]Â This knowledge of deeper truths requires the specialÂ firaasaÂ that is a gift from Allah, stemming from His light.\nImam al-Ghazali (d. 505 AH) conceptualizedÂ firaasaÂ as stemming from a âwindowâ in the heart that opens to the world of the unseen. The other windows represent our normal physical senses. When a person focuses on his soul rather than the physical world, different impressions from the unseen world are perceived. He explains that this is the reason most visions that are truthful occur in the dream state, when the body is cut off from the sensory world,\n\nIn the state of sleep, when the avenues of the senses are closed, this window is opened and man receives impressions from the unseen world and sometimes foreshadowings of the future. His heart is then like a mirror which reflects what is pictured in the Tablet of Fate. But, even in sleep, thoughts of worldly things dull this mirror so that the impressions it receives are not clear.[51]\n\nWe see similar imagery discussed by Ibn al-Qayyim regarding the heart being like glass and a mirror. Imam al-Ghazali explains that in the conscious state, a person can still perceive through the unseen window in accordance with the purity of their heart, âThe more a man purifies himself from fleshly lusts and concentrates his mind on Allah, the more conscious will he be of such intuitions. Those who are not conscious of them have no right to deny their reality.â[52]\nThus, we can understandÂ firaasaÂ as light coming from Allah that encapsulates meanings of hidden realities. This light interacts with the pure heart of a believer and projects an accurate image to its consciousness. The quality of this light is much greater than any other thought, idea, or knowledge that the individual possesses since it comes straight from Allah. Thus, it outshines any other thought related to it and remains fixed in the heart.\nSummary\nWe have discussed the structural components of the unconscious that influence the conscious outpouring of thoughts that occur at every moment in our minds. Our conscious thoughts are continuously being altered and formulated based on complex interactions between components of the unconscious. It is important to note that we are not advocating an entirely deterministic view of the thoughts that emerge involuntarily from the unconscious. A person can intentionally counteractÂ Â unconsciousÂ influences. For instance, personality transformation can help change ourÂ khawaatirÂ by elevating ourÂ nafsÂ closer to theÂ nafs mutmaâinn. Seeking refuge in Allah and strengthening the fortresses of our heart can aid us in our battle against satanic whispers. Having friends that inspire us with their words and behavior fill our memory with positive ideas that become readily available for extraction when confronted with a difficult situation. Developing our character and intellect can aid us in appropriately integrating the desires of the self. Personal hygiene[53]Â and being in angelic environments can increase the positive forces that come from the angels. Lastly, the processes involved inÂ Â purification of the soulÂ will bring about greaterÂ firaasa.\nSection 3: Process of Thinking\nIn terms of the process of thinking, the Quran utilizes a diverse set of terms that share the general meaning of contemplation but individually contain subtle differences regarding the intricacies of thinking. Some exegetes of the Quran have described 30 different terms that are used such as thinkingÂ (tafakkur), reflecting (tadabbur), and remembering (tadhakkur)Â that are essential processes required to effectively extract meaning from the signs of Allah in the Quran and the natural world.[54]Â \nThis section of the article touches upon a concept known as metacognitionâor âthinking about thinkingââthat has become popular in recent years.[55]Â The process of thinking about thoughts is a higher-order form of thinking that determines how we interpret the world around us. The cognitive strategy we choose to undertake in a given situation involves a metacognitive choice that will dictate the quality and quantity of knowledge we can abstract from it.[56]Â These units of knowledge can then proceed to form conceptual frameworks through which future information is understood. Thus, the Quran provides us with the metacognitive guidance necessary to abstract meaning and truth from the world, providing us with conceptual frameworks that enable us to see the world as it really is.\nComponents of Contemplation\nIbn al-Qayyim includes a fascinating discussion on the different types of thinking in his bookÂ Miftaah Dar as-Saâadah. He provides an explanation of the terms used in the Quran to denote contemplation. This section will focus on his discussion ofÂ tafakkurÂ (thinking),Â tadhakkurÂ (remembering),Â iâtibaarÂ (realizing), andÂ tadabburÂ (deliberating). The first two processes describe ways in which initial thoughts can emerge through deliberate choice (rather than automatically through the unconscious); the latter two describe how initial thoughts (whether automatic or deliberate) can lead to new insights and knowledge.\nTafakkur\nÂ âTafakkur: To bring something to oneâs cognitive space.â[57]Â \nThis is the main form of thinking the Quran references.Â FikrÂ is the most general of these terms and encompasses the process of bringing a thought to conscious awareness.Â TafakkurÂ is distinct fromÂ khawaatirÂ in that it is a more deliberate process by which an individual chooses to direct and focus their thoughts. In this circumstance, the initial thought brought to consciousness is derived either from the environment or through an innate creative process that is independent of our environments. Hence,Â khawaatirÂ involves a predominantly passive process whileÂ tafakkurÂ is an active process.\nTadhakkur\nâTadhakkur: Bringing awareness of knowledge that requires attention after a person has been distracted from it or it is unseen to him: âCertainly those who are righteous, when a party of shaytaan touches them, they immediately remember (tadkhakkar), then they gain insightâ (Surah Aâraaf: 201).â[58]\nWhen a person has been affected by the whispers of Satan or by their carnal passions, they are in dire need of this method of thinking.Â TadhakkarÂ involves the ability to draw on knowledge that a person has previously acquired as a means of defending against the delusions of Satan and curbing their desires. When a person is overcome with jealousy stemming from ingratitude, materialism, and contempt for others, he must bring to mind knowledge ofÂ al-QadarÂ (Divine Decree). By remembering that Allah distributes His bountiesÂ toÂ whom He wills, one understands Â that being jealous of others involves challenging the validity of Allahâs Decree. Through reflection of this sort one gains insight into the diseases plaguing oneâs heart as well as appreciation for oneâs own blessings. When a person has been overcome by addictive urges stemming from a mind incapable of postponing gratification and a heart that craves pleasure, he must remember the One who he is disobeying, His power, His Might, His grandeur. In âIddat as-Sabireen, Ibn al-Qayyim advises the one overcome with passion to bring 20 different thoughts to conscious awareness. For the sake of brevity, we will mention just three of them.[59]Â \n1. Remember Allahâs countless blessings upon you and that your disobedience will erect a barrier between you and them. Â \n2. Remember that through your fulfilling of desires and attainment of temporary pleasure you will lose out on goodness both in this world and in the next. Â Faith, providence, and wealth all decrease as a consequence.\n3. Remember that Allah has promised to replace what you leave for His sake with something much better. It is worth the struggle.\nWhen a person draws these forgotten treasures from beneath the sands of his heart, he can repurchase his soul after almost selling it for a miserable price. Remembering these pearls of wisdom allows a person to break free from the delusions of Satan and see the world as it is, a journey towards Allah. He sees whatever hinders this path as challenges, and whatever facilitates the path as gifts.\nTafakkur and Tadhakkur\nTafakkurÂ andÂ tadhakkurÂ together create a system that works to enrich the human mind with knowledge.Â TadhakkurÂ is the process by which the heart constantly re-evaluatesÂ knowledge it has learned in light of new experiences, in order to gain deeper insight and firm grounding (fahm). A person who knows that âAllahÂ reigns Supreme over his matterâ (Surah Yusuf: 21), realizesâno matter how alone he feels in this crowded world, or how conquered he feels by the negativity and pessimism of those surrounding himâthat Allahâs Decree prevails over all. A person who brings this thought to conscious awareness as he goes through struggle or difficulty, and when he achieves relief and success, will gain a deeper insightÂ intoÂ Allahâs role in his life. Thus, successive trials become easier, as his heart finds rest in remembering Allah. If a person does not engage inÂ tadhakkurÂ of what he has learnedÂ about AllahÂ wheneverÂ he encounters a new situation, he willÂ eventuallyÂ lose this knowledge and it will no longer impact his heart. The knowledge will ârustâ in the heart, making it inaccessible at the times it is needed the most:Â âRather their hearts have rusted because of what they earned.â[60]\nThrough sincere advice, motivational reminders, and inspirational encounters with the signs of Allah, this rust is shaved off allowing the previously acquired knowledge to float freely in our consciousness. Ibn Qayyim mentions, â(TadhakkurÂ is done) so the heart does not lose the effect of its knowledge, and so it does not disappear.â[61]Â \nThe function ofÂ tafakkurÂ is described as âincreasing oneâs knowledge and allowing the heart to attain what it previously did not have.â[62]Â Together, Ibn al-Qayyim explains,Â âTafakkurÂ builds the heart andÂ tadhakkurÂ preserves it.Â TafakkurÂ andÂ tadhakkurÂ are the seeds of knowledge. The rains come and nourish them (tafakkur) and remembering (tadhakkur) is its vaccination.â[63]\nIâtibaar\nâIâtibaar: It is linguistically derived fromÂ âuboor, which means crossing. This is because a person goes from an original thought to a new realization (maârifah) through this type of thinking. This is the goal ofÂ iâtibaar. It is a constructive process whereby existing thoughts are synthesized to produce more profound and sophisticated realizations.\nâCertainly in their stories is a profound realization (âibrah) for the people of sound intellect.â (Surah Yusuf: 11)\nâCertainly in that is a profound realization (âibrah) for the one who is in Awe.â (Surah Naziâaat: 26)\nâCertainly in that is a profound realization (âibrah) for the people of insight.â (Surah Ali-Imran: 13; Surah Noor: 44).â[64]\nThis is a secondary process that is enacted upon Â pre-existing thoughts in the mind. In the Quran, this process is linked with pondering over stories. The process by which the mind extracts profound lessons from a story is known asÂ iâtibaar. Moving from a raw story to a profound realization through the bridge ofÂ iâtibaarÂ involves the process of abstraction. This allows one to achieve a meta-lesson from the narrative that can be applied to oneâs own life, despite obvious differences with the original story. For example, when we read about the story of Maryam and Zakariyya being able to bear children despite them believing it was not possible, we learn to conquer our own self-limiting beliefs and realize our full potential through the power of Allah. When we read about the dark story of the fall of Shaytaan, we gain insight into the satanic thoughts or diseases that may plague our own hearts and minds. When we read about the story of redemption of our father Adam, we are given hope for a better future and inspiration to change for the better.\nTadabbur\nâTadabbur: It is called this because it is focused on theÂ adbaarÂ (the end) of a matter. It is the logical consequence of a starting thought. This is used in reference to speech:\nâDo they not consider the consequences of the speech (the Quran)?â(SurahÂ Muâminoon: 68)\nâDo they not ponder (yatadabaroon) the Quran?â (Surah Nisaa: 82).â[65]\nTadabburÂ is to follow a thought to either its logical end or starting foundation. On a practical level,Â tadabburÂ of the Quran is the process by which a reader looks at a verse and determines the implications of its meaningsÂ forÂ their life. When we truly consider the statement âMy Mercy encompasses everythingâ (Surah Aâraaf: 156) withÂ tadabburÂ while going through a difficulty, then we necessarily come to the conclusion that the pain, suffering,Â and difficulty I am going through is enveloped in Allahâs Divine Mercy. As IbnÂ al-Qayyim explains elsewhere, âOut of the wisdom of Allah, He has made pleasure give rise to pain, and pain give rise to pleasure.â[66]Â Thus, the pain one is experiencing due to the loss of a loved one, a broken heart, financial restraints, social isolation or depression is all enveloped in the Divine Plan of Mercy and Wisdom. This is a firm belief of the believer as he sails through the strong winds of life, never losing hope. He has pondered over the verses of the Quran that speak of theÂ bounties,Â blessings,Â andÂ love of Allah for His slaves and has come to no other conclusion than, âSo verily with hardship, comes ease. Verily with hardship, comes easeâ[67]Â (Surah Inshirah: 5-6).\nThoughts to Behavior\nHuman beings are capable of impeding or acting contrary to impulses or thoughts that arise in their minds. Furthermore, they are able to engage in metacognition to change or incorporate thoughts into networks of knowledge. The process by which a conscious thought becomes knowledge and thenÂ behaviorÂ is outlined by Ibn al-Qayyim who states that there are five cognitive-behavioral stations that are causally linked, âAnd so there are five states:Â fikrÂ (thought), which gives rise toÂ âilmÂ (knowledge), which gives rise to aÂ haalaÂ (paradigm or conceptual architecture) that stimulates the heart, which gives rise to anÂ iraadaÂ (motivational drive), which gives rise to anÂ âamlÂ (action).â[68]\nExpanding Ibn al-Qayyimâs Model\nFikr, Ilm,Â and Haal\nThe first step is (1)Â fikr, which involves bringing awareness of new information or thoughts to oneâs mind. As a personÂ recalls the new informationÂ to guide his or her decisions, he engages inÂ tadhakkurÂ and it becomes (2)Â ilm. If the information does not aid a person on their spiritual, intellectual, and moral journey, it has not reached the level of knowledge and stays at (1)Â fikr. Thus, knowledge is defined by its ability to bring benefit to a personâs life. As bits of knowledge develop from theÂ thingsÂ we think about, theyÂ becomeÂ arrangements of knowledge. The patternsÂ of these arrangements of knowledge are determined by our logic and reasoning along with our character. For example, words in a sentence are strung together based on the rules of grammar to produce a meaningful statement. However, the choice of content stems from our character and values. If a person values truth, the content of his speech will always be truthful. If a person is selfish, then the sentences he constructs will beÂ usedÂ to manipulate others. In this analogy, the words represent knowledge, grammar represents rationality,Â and the sentence itself represents the specific arrangement of knowledge.Â Thus, pieces of knowledge are connected in arrangements based on rationality, just as words are connected in arrangements based on grammar.Â The end&#8211;products are knowledge structures. These represent anchors, axioms, starting points,Â and foundations through which we interpret subsequent information about ourselves and our environment. This information is transformed into knowledge and added to existing knowledge structures toÂ build newÂ foundations orÂ toÂ build and enrichÂ existing ones. Following our analogyÂ withÂ language, the sentences that represent our knowledge structures are further combined to produce paragraphs. These paragraphs are combined to produce passages, which are subsequently combined to produce a complete book. The entire arrangement that emerges from our set of knowledge structures is the (3)Â haalÂ (conceptual architecture).\nThe Heart as a Lens\nThe conceptual architecture of the mind is the lens of the heart through which the environment is processed. This lens is referenced in the Quran,\nâAllah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass is as if it were a pearly star and it is lit from the oil of a blessed olive treeâ¦â[69]Â \nAs IbnÂ al-Qayyim explains, the glassÂ representsÂ the heart, and theÂ lamp representsÂ the light of faith that illuminates the soul.[70]Â One of the reasons why glass is used asÂ a symbol ofÂ the heart is because of its clarity. Ibn al-Qayyim says, âBy its clarity, (the believer) sees truth and direction.â[71]\nWhen the physical light of this world reflectsÂ offÂ theÂ ayaatÂ (signs) in creation and is perceived by the heart, the light refracts and produces an image. The clarity and depth of the image is based on the complexity of the conceptual architecture. More complex architectures are derived from richer and wider knowledge structures combined with intelligence and good character. The image represents meaning that is abstracted from the signs of Allah.\nThree Orders of Meaning\nThisÂ meaning can be classified intoÂ threeÂ levels. The first order of meaning emerges from the empirical features of the signs. It requires the sensory system of the mind to be able to perceive. The meanings associated with it are in the domain ofÂ khabarÂ (description). For instance, a particular rock formation can be explained scientifically by merely describing its appearance, shape, color,Â and composition. This is meaning that has emerged from the sign in the form ofÂ khabar. This can be regarded as (1)Â fikr.\nThe second order of meaning arises from rational deliberationÂ uponÂ the sign and is known as (2)Â ilm. Cognitive processes are required to abstract meaning in relation to the etiology or purpose (hikmah) of a particular natural phenomenon embedded in a wider context. Continuing from the previous example, explaining the geological processes that led to the rock formation along with its current role in the ecosystem ofÂ a particular geographicalÂ Â area would all qualify as second&#8211;order meanings. Second&#8211;order meanings have resulted in great technological advancement throughout history, especially in recent centuries.\nThe third and final order of meaning arises from a myriad of cognitive processes along with psycho-spiritual states described in the Quran. Distraction and vice hinder a personâs ability to recognize thisÂ levelÂ of meaning. The Quran consistently explains the signs of Allah as beingÂ perceptible onlyÂ by people with faith, conviction, knowledge,Â and intellect through the actionsÂ of contemplation, remembrance, deliberation, listening,Â and seeing. The fundamental cognitive process that occursÂ at this levelÂ is known asÂ Qiyaas bil-AwlaaÂ (High-order Analogy). This is referenced in the Quran, âAnd to Allah belongs the highest analogy.â[72]Â Thus, relying on purely literal and syllogistic thinking will blind a person from this order of meaning.Â Qiyaas bil-AwlaaÂ involvesÂ abstracting values (moral, intellectual,Â and spiritual) from the natural world and appropriately recognizing their ontological and epistemological dependenceÂ onÂ the Divine (maârifah). The values that are abstracted are Divine Names and Attributes manifested in a limited form in this reality. The beauty, majesty,Â and awe that arise from gazing upon the rock formation, along with the recognition of the metaphysical basis for these values in the DivineÂ constituteÂ the essence of this highest order of meaning.\nProcessing Third-Order Meanings\nThe processing of all meanings primarily occurs through the (3)Â haalÂ of heart as described earlier. Specifically, third&#8211;order meanings require a more complex conceptual architecture that remains untarnished. Some lenses have become tarnished, rendering them blind to this layer of meaning. Ibn al-Qayyim says, âAnd if tarnish builds up, blackens,Â and envelops the heart completely, the heartâs reflective quality and perception will be totally lost, so that it will neither accept what is true nor reject what is false.â[73]Â \nThe Quran often describes the psycho-spiritual state of people who are unable to perceive the light that emerges from the signs of Allah. In fact, this reality is first expressed as early as the third page of the Quran,\nâCertainly, those who reject faith, they are indifferent to your warnings and will never believe. Allah has sealed their hearts and ears and veiled their sight. For them is a painful punishment.â[74]\nThe Haal inspires Iraadah\nWhen the conceptual architecture is formed from our knowledge, reasoning,Â and good character, it stimulates the heart, resulting in the phenomenological experience of spiritual stations. The meaningsÂ perceivedÂ inÂ the signs of Allah stir the heart towardÂ tawakkulÂ (reliance on Allah),Â sabrÂ (perseverance andÂ patience,)Â shukrÂ (gratitude),Â khawfÂ (fear),Â mahabbaÂ (love) andÂ rajaaâÂ (hope). These spiritual stationsÂ are experienced as a person sees the Names and Attributes of Allah through His signs. From this stage, our (4)Â iraadaÂ (ambitions, will, choices,Â and decisions) emerge. From oneâs will and ambitions come (5) behavior and action.\nSummary\nIbn al-Qayyim concludes from his theory of the connection between thought and behavior,\nFikr is the beginning and the key to all that is good. And this (framework) should make clear the significance and value of tafakkur and that it is the most virtuous and beneficial action the heart can engage in until it was even said, âEngaging in tafakkur for one hour is better than one yearâs worth of worship.â Fikr is what takes a person from the death and slumber of distraction to being awake and alive. From what he hates to what he loves, from worldly dependency to worldly independence, from the prison of this world to the freedom of the next, from the constraints of ignorance to the expansion of knowledge, from the disease of desire to the cure of turning to Allah, from blindness, deafness, and dumbness to the blessings of sight, hearing,Â and the profound understanding of Allah, from the disease of doubts to the relief of certainty.[75]Â \nThen what is the state of a person who does not engage inÂ tafakkur? Ibn al-Qayyim makes a beautiful analogy of the heart as a piece of land. It can either grow from the seeds of your thoughts, or your greatest enemy can seize the land and sow whatever he wishes:\n\nShaytaan encounters the land of the heart as empty and barren, so he plants seeds that will lead to satanic thoughts giving rise to passions, forbidden urges and desires. This will then lead to (forbidden and destructive) actions. But if the land of the heart is busy with good and beneficial thoughts regarding oneâs purpose in life, thinking about accountability and the next life, its eternal delights and painful punishments, then there will be no room for oneâs desires.[76]Â \n\nSection 4: A System of Islamic Contemplation\nThe preceding sections focused on the desired process of thinking. This concluding section will focus on the desired content of thinking. Ibn al-Qayyim mentions the four general categories of thoughts that should be actively cultivated:[77]\n\nOur most beloved purpose;\nThe path that leads to fulfilling this purpose;\nHarm that leads toÂ punishment; and\nThe paths that lead to this harm\n\nThere is no such thing as a neutral thought. Life is conceptualized as a path towards a particular destination. If at any point in time a person does not move towards their destination during the journey, they are considered having âlost time.â Thus, mankind is always in a state of loss unless they are actively pursuing their end-goal. This is illustrated beautifully in the Quran,\nâBy time. Verily mankind is in a state of loss, unless they believe, do good deeds, call each other to truth, and call each other to patience.â (Surah Asr: 1-3)\nTherefore, if oneâs thoughts do not fit into any of the four categories described above, they are considered vain thoughts.[78]Â These thoughts feed the evil that exists within the human being. They drive a person towards failure. The key to success in this world and the next is to ensure oneâs consciousness is filled with positive thoughts that will ultimately result in positive behaviors.\nIbn al-Qayyim explains that any time a person is in a motivational state toward a particular destination, person, or objective it necessarily implies they love what they are oriented towards.[79]Â Motivation is sustained in accordance with the strength of love for the end-goal. Â \nThis love is strengthened through the fourÂ categories of thought. The first category of positive thoughts is thinking about a personâs most important or most beloved objective. Ibn Qayyim divides these thoughts into two categories: (1) pondering its intrinsic beauty; and (2) pondering the benefit received from it.[80]\nThe ultimate Beloved of a human being is Allah, The Transcendent, The Source of Peace, The Truth. Thinking about His beautiful qualities engenders love that sustains and strengthens the motivational state. Pondering His Beauty, Perfection, Tranquility, Peace, Love, Compassion and Goodness through theÂ ayaatÂ he has spread throughout earth will build the foundation of love.Â Then, you should remember that Allah is the One Who created you, your body, your soul, your very essence and granted you the gift of lifeÂ itself.Â His Love and Care has been sent down through the love and care of your parents. Allah is the One Who pulled you out of the hardships in your life, and helped you accomplish your goals. And most importantly, Allah is the One Who pulled you out of the darkness of this world into His light.\nThe human being then transitions from thoughts about their ultimate purpose to thoughts of how to fulfill that purpose. If a person is constantly thinking about Allah, they will yearn to seek a relationship with Him. The thoughts will then focus on what factors facilitate or hinder oneâs spiritual ascent towards Allah. Since human behavior is fundamentally determined by motivational states, contemplating the consequences of the enablers and hinderers of this purpose is paramount. This is where Ibn al-Qayyim derived the other three categories of thoughts. He also adds subcategories to be more specific. The system is as follows:[81]\n\nThinking about our most beloved purpose\n\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â a. Thinking about His Beauty and Attributes\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â b. Thinking about His Actions, Kindness, and Providence that indicate His Beneficence\n\nThe path that leads to fulfilling this purpose\n\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â a. Thinking about qualities that are loved by The Beloved. A person performs a character review and ponders,\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â i. Is this quality loved by Allah or not?\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â ii. Do I have this quality?\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â iii. If I donât, how do I obtain it? If I do, how do I preserve it?\n\nThinking about our most despised ends[82]\n\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â a. Thinking about their ugliness\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â b. Thinking about the pain and harm that would result from the despised ends\n\nThe paths that lead to our most despised ends and result in punishment\n\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â a. Thinking about qualities that are despised by The Beloved. A person performs a character review and ponders,\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â i. Is this quality hated by Allah or not?\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â ii.Â If this quality is hated, do I have it orÂ not?\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â iii. If I donât, how do I preserve that and make sure I am free from it? If I do, how do I remove this quality?\nWhen putting them all together, Ibn al-Qayyim explains that the first category increases a personâs love for Allah, and the remaining categories make the individual more beloved to Allah. He also reduces them to the following three points:[83]\n\nKnowledge of AllahâsÂ TawheedÂ (Divine Unity) and Attributes\nPath towards Allah\nPaths away from Allah\n\nThis thought process is embodied in Surah Fatiha itself. The first four verses speak to Allahâs Names and Attributes and worshipping Him alone. The fifthÂ Â and sixth verses speak about the pathway to Allah and the seventh verse speaks about the pathways away from Allah.\nConclusion\nIt is paramount in this age of distraction that we turn our focus inwards to discover the secrets of the mind. The experiences of thinking and consciousness are deeply spiritual and can unlock many hidden treasures inside of us. They represent one of the greatest miracles of this universe. They are the basis for our aims and ambitions in life. They are the building blocks of the emotions we experience. Through contemplation, remembrance, and reflection we can build vast and magnificent structures in our hearts from the material of knowledge and understanding. In this way, our conceptual architecture is similar to architectural landscapes constructed in the physical world. The buildings and paths enable the inhabitants of a city to traverse the physical world of matter. Similarly our conceptual architecture enables us to traverse the metaphysical world of meaning. Knowledge structures are the buildings and the processes of thinking (tafakkur, tadhakkur, iâtibaarÂ andÂ tadhakkur) are the pathways that connect them together. Collectively, they can produce aÂ shiningÂ civilizationÂ within our hearts that enrichesÂ our experience in this world.\nThe Islamic tradition has much to offer the field of human psychology. This article has focused on cognitions and metacognitions, exploring their building blocks, processes,Â and aims. The second article in this series will focus on motivation, behavior and personality transformation, completing our introductory study of Islamic Spiritual Psychology.\n\n\n\n[1]Â Quran, 87:14\n\n\n[2]Â Quran, 91:9\n\n\n[3]Â https://Roadsiderinstitute.org/en/zohair/islamic-spirituality-and-mental-well-being/Â \n\n\n[4]Â The degrees of motivation are typically described with reference to the following line of poetry:\nÙØ±Ø§ØªØ¨ Ø§ÙÙØµØ¯ Ø®ÙØ³ ÙØ§Ø¬Ø³ Ø°ÙØ±ÙØ§\nÙØ®Ø§Ø·Ø± ÙØ­Ø¯ÙØ« Ø§ÙÙÙØ³ ÙØ§Ø³ØªÙØ¹Ø§\nÙÙÙÙ ÙÙ ÙØ¹Ø²Ù ÙÙÙØ§ Ø±ÙØ¹Øª\nØ³ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ£Ø®ÙØ± ÙÙÙÙ Ø§ÙØ£Ø®Ø° ÙØ¯ ÙÙØ¹Ø§\nThis line is cited by the famous Qurâanic commentator Al-Alusi (d. 1270 H) inÂ Ruh al-MaâaniÂ (Beirut: Dar Ihya Turath al-Arabi 1985) vol.Â 3, p.Â 64 (explanation of 2:284).

One can never be too clear about things these days, so before delving into the topic I want to state clearly my own position: I categorically and unconditionally condemn the killing of noncombatants by anyone, whether state or non-state actors, uniformed military or insurgents. I take the position of Imam Malik and al-Awzaâi, that one is not permitted to kill civilians even if it seems necessary to achieve some valid military objective. It isÂ neverÂ acceptable. I think it is vital for us as American Muslims to demonstrate our concern for all human beings, not just Americans and not just Muslims. We have to speak and rise up anytime that any of Godâs creation is attacked, regardless of whether the victims are Muslims or not.\nHaving gotten that out of the way, I want to start by talking about a film. It is a movie shot in Chicago (where I attended graduate school) and tells the story of a man who seeks out his own death. In the film,Â Stranger than FictionÂ (2006), the hero, played by Will Ferrell, discovers that a local author is actually dictating the story of his lifeâthe book this author is writing is literally governing his existence. He confronts the author and (spoiler!) asks her for the ending that she has written, only to find out that she has him die in the very near future pushing a child out of the way of a bus. Instead of fleeing from this fate, the hero embraces it. He goes to his end willingly, explaining to the author that he can imagine no better, more poetic, death. Let us keep this image in mind; let it set the tone.\nWriting this essay was an attempt to answer a question that has tasked my mind and conscience for many years now, certainly since the horrible events of September 11th, that day which, in my life at least, separates the carefree Golden Age of optimistic youth from the exhausted and somber alloy of the present. Put simply: no Muslim can deny that our God praises martyrs. The Quran makes this abundantly clear. Those Muslims who die âfighting in the path of Godâ reside in the highest levels of Paradise. They are not truly even dead. Rather, they are instant immortals, as the Quran says, âalive, sustained with their Lordâ (QuranÂ 3:169). Martyrsâ bodies are not even washed for burial in Islam, and they bypass the trials and tribulations of the grave. It is as if they do not have to wait for Judgment Day to reap their rewards.\nCertainly, death in battle is not the only way to achieve martyrdom in Islam. Those who die unjustly or whose lives are truncated by some act of God are martyrs as well. Someone who is killed for their money (like a friend of mine at the University of Chicago, Ahmadou Cisse,Â rahimahu Allah,Â who was murdered one night in Hyde Park), someone who drowns, someone who dies building a mosque or in a structural collapse, a woman who dies in childbirth, the victims of a plague, someone who is killed defending their family, someone who is killed for speaking truth to an unjust ruler, who dies in prison or who stands alone for truth in corrupted times; even (according to oneÂ hadith) someone who falls in love and represses their desire with fatal consequencesâallÂ these are martyrs.[1]Â One weakÂ hadith, by the way, puts honest merchants at almost the same level of martyrsâ¦ I guess showing how rare honest merchants are (?).[2]Â But in the Quran andÂ hadith, martyrs are first and foremost those who have died inÂ jihad, âfighting in the path of God,â those who have perished violently in battle.\nSo hereâs the rub. We are Muslims whose holy book praises those martyred in battle, yet today whenever we hear of Muslims claiming to be martyrs it is a news report of someone blowing up innocent civilians in a market place. How can we reconcile this awful conflict? How should we understand martyrdom? This is the quandary (well, one of many) that faces Muslims today.\nDiscussions of martyrdom in Islam inevitably turn on the issue of suicide attacks and what âIslam says about them.â As I always tell my students any time they raise a question about what Islam or Islamic law says about anything, there is almost always more than one answer. Purposefully seeking oneâs own death in battle and the permissibility of killing civilians are no exceptions.\nWe must note, of course, thatÂ no classical Muslim scholarÂ allowed the blatant, unmitigated killing of civilians. Here the Islamic legal tradition would disagree with the 1945 Allied firebombing of the cities of Dresden and Tokyo, which killed around 35,000 and 100,000 civilians respectively and had no tactical military aim (in Germany, US government estimates were that 24% of the bombs fell on residential and commercial areas, and 19% of casualties were children under 16â¦ in Japan it was much, much worse).[3]Â Just like the policies of the American government, disagreements among Muslim scholars do predictably arise when one asks whether one can kill non-combatants if they are mixed in with the enemy army and even if one can kill Muslims who are being used by the enemy as human shields. Some Sunni Muslim scholars have held that the death of innocent civilians might be inevitable if they&#8217;re mixed in with the enemyâbut otherwise intentionally targeting civilians is totally prohibited.Â This is equivalent to the US governmentâs policy of avoiding âcollateral damageâ to the extent possible and falls along the same lines as theÂ doctrine of double effectÂ in Western theory on just war. Some Muslim scholars have proven even more cautious.Â The eighth-century scholars Malik and al-Awzaâi, for example, declared that killing women and children is never permissible.\nOn the issue of whether or not a Muslim can purposefully kill himself in order to kill the enemy, the general opinion of classical Muslim scholars is no. This would be prohibited due to the impermissibility of suicide in Islam. Like American soldiers who are awarded the Medal of Honor, a Muslim is allowed to heroically engage in an action that will almost certainly result in his death. But this is not the same as killing oneself in the act of killing the enemyâit is not suicideÂ per seÂ since the agent of killing (the killer) is not the same person as the person killed.\nI do not want to focus on what Islamic law says about suicide attacks because I do not think this is truly a legal issue in the eyes of the American public. It is not about what we allow or prohibit, but about how we respond emotionally to suffering and injustice. It is about emotion and perception, not rules and law. Think of the brilliantÂ OnionÂ Point/Counterpoint article in that publicationâs eminently tasteful response to 9/11. The two positions being argued in the piece were, on the one hand, âWe Must Retaliate With Blind Rage,âÂ versus, on the other, âWe Must Retaliate With Measured, Focused Rage.â A brief sample:\n\nAfter pummeling the holy living hell out of those f&#8212;&#8211;s with bombs, we should send in ground troops, armed to the teeth, to sweep through and exterminate anyone still alive who might have been involved. America&#8217;s soldiers must be under orders to pump round after round into their bodies, pausing only to replace their clips.Â Vs.Â While leveling Afghanistan, Iraq, the Sudan, and Libya with bombs might seem like a justifiable moveâ¦ Have we made sure we have the support of other key powers in the region, so that further problems don&#8217;t develop after we bomb them back into the Stone Age?\n\nHow perfectly this satire (if in fact itâs satire) encapsulates the primordial, hyperbolic desire for revenge that understandably flooded America after 9/11. No matter which side you took in this debate, the urge was the sameâall of them, them, they all must die. Now letâs shift our gaze for a moment away from âkill âem allâ to an image of a little old Afghan woman, kindly helping her granddaughter put on her first pair of shoes. Could we in any way call for them to be massacred in a fit of revenge? Truly the question of âTo kill or not to killâ is often more emotive than principled. An Arab man might call for Israel to be pushed into the sea, but could he raise the same cry if he saw an old Israeli mother, sobbing, waiting anxiously for news of her missing son? This, then, is what I want to focus on: emotion, not law.\nThe importance of visceral, emotive perception is obvious when suicide attacks are discussed in America. What is a suicide attack, after all? More to the point, what is it about suicide attacks that horrifies us? I would think that what would truly make our blood boil is the fact that these attacks generally target and brutally end the lives of innocent civilians. This seems fairly obvious. But if this were the case, if that were indeed what lies at the heart of suicide attacks and our outrage towards them, then this essay would end right now. Iâve already made it clear that killing civilians is unacceptable to Muslim scholars and that any equivocation on the issue is an unfortunate reality shared by both Islamic law and the policies of the US military. (Remember, aÂ 2007 pollÂ found that 6% of Americans felt that âattacks in which civilians are targets are âcompletely justified.ââ Only 4% of Saudis and 2% of Iranians did. AÂ 2017 pollÂ found that, when asked whether âtargeting and killing civilians can be justified to further a political, social or religious cause,â 84% of U.S. Muslims said such tactics are never (76%) or rarely (8%) justified. In comparison, in a survey of the U.S. public as a whole, only 59% said itâsÂ neverÂ justifiable.)\nBut clearly suicide attacks hold some special horror for us. The type of attack has its own name (with the equally terrifying âsuicide bombingâ as a subset) after all, for a reason. There is something about its suicidal dimensionâthe decision of the attacker to take his/her own life in this violent actâthat truly grips us. This is clear from a bizarre debate that appeared in America over the term âsuicide bombing.â In 2003 Condoleezza Rice and others made a short-lived effort to replace the term with âhomicide bombing,â as if they were afraid that people had gotten the impression that this was a reflexive act impacting only the actor. This was not a Buddhist monk setting himself on fire in protest, Rice was trying to say. This was an act of mass murder. The awkwardness of this term âhomicide bombingâ (akin perhaps to âviolent baseball bat beatingâ) only revealed our elliptical fascination with the suicidal component of suicide attacks.\nLet us then assume that it is the suicidal dimension of that act that truly turns the screw in our collective conscienceâ¦ that there is something that we either cannot understand or hope not to be able to understand about someone choosing to die in an act of killing others. Scholars have suggested multiple motivationsÂ for suicide attacks: an escape from political oppression, a collective death wish, an act of social sacrifice, or a political/military strategy. These may all be correct, but I want to look beyond these diagnoses at something both more general and more ancient.\nIâll pause here to lay two images before you. First, aÂ climactic sceneÂ from the very popular 1996 filmÂ Independence DayÂ (there was recently some sort of sequelâ¦ that will have to wait for airplane viewing). As the massive and invulnerable alien battle cruiser is about to destroy one of humanityâs last bases, Randy Quaid, previously an impoverished alcoholic with some knowledge of flying, aims the nose of his FA-18 Hornet into the one exposed part of the alien ship and detonates his plane, killing himself and destroying the enemy. His children watch the attack on a screen from the base below. The commander turns to the children and says, âYour father did a very brave thing; you should be proud of him.â âI am,â says the child. We, the audience, concur. Indeed, what a worthy act, what a noble way to die.\nSecond, a story from my own life. Once when I was in the Western Desert of Egypt, far into the desert near the Libyan border with the Awlad Ali Bedouins, attending a wedding, I met a man named Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr came to the tent we were staying in on a camel. He dismounted, looming and powerful, and started to give me an unsolicited lesson about proper religion. At one point in his lecture, he looked at me and pointed to his head. âI want a bullet, right here, inÂ jihad,â he said. I can say in all honesty that in all my years of traveling I have never been as frightened as I was at that moment, and never have I felt farther away from home.\nSince then, Iâve often thought about how I felt when Abu Bakr said that. Why was I so afraid? Was it the prejudice of expectationâbecause he was Arab, Muslim, becauseÂ jihadÂ must mean killing people who looked like me, my family? Why was I so afraid of what he was saying and yet so moved by Randy Quaidâs heroic death inÂ Independence Day? Were their two wishes really that different?Â They both wanted to give their lives for a cause they felt was noble.Â The only difference, it seemed, was whether they were on âourâ side of the fight or not. I was walking in the streets of Cairo a few months later when the manifest commonality of their desire dawned upon me: there is no culture in this world, I thought, that does not value dying well, dying a noble death.\nThe Greek scholar Herodotus (d.Â circaÂ 420 BCE) tells of a meeting between Croesus, the powerful king of Lydia, and the Athenian lawmaker Solon. Croesus asks Solon who the happiest, most fortunate man he had ever met was, expecting of course that Solon would name the wealthy king himself. Instead Solon replies that the most blessed and fortunate man he had ever come across was a simple Athenian named Tellus. This Tellus had lived a full life in a prosperous city, had had children who lived to adulthood, had been blessed with grandchildren, and finally âhad a glorious deathâ in battle, fighting for Athens. We can see a similar theme in a Herodotus redux, the wildly profitable filmÂ 300. In it, one of the heroic Spartan warriors (played by Michael Fassbender), facing almost certain annihilation at the spears of a monstrous enemy horde, explains that he hopes for âa beautiful death,â namely a glorious death in an epic battle against a worthy foe.\nWhat is it that makes these deaths so beautiful, so felicitous? Well, Solon tells Croesus that Tellusâ death in battle was made glorious because it was celebrated and remembered by the people of Athens. Herodotus tells us that he has learned the names of every one of the 300 Spartans who fought at Thermopylae, and how pleased that brave Spartan would be if he knew that fully two and a half millennia later Americans were watching his âbeautiful deathâ played out on screen. Put simply, in the classical world a beautiful death, a glorious death, was one that was remembered and celebrated. It is a death that allows you to cheat mortality, to live on in human memory, and gain a species of immortality. This is what the Greeks calledÂ kleos, or glory and renown. It is the same perpetuating elixir of memory that the Pre-Islamic Arabs calledÂ hasabÂ orÂ maâÄthÄ«r, those heroic deeds sung of in epics.Â It is what the ghost of Agamemnon envies the ghost of Achilles for in the underworld, how âeven in death your name will never dieâ¦ Great glory is yours Achilles, for all time, in the eyes of all mankind.â[4]\nIt is such glory that comforts men sorely aware of their mortality.Â Pindar (d.Â circaÂ 440 BCE) writes, âDonât be deceived by cunning thrift: glory follows a man, glory alone, when he is dead, reveals his manner of life to the lords of song and story.â[5]Â Â In that great classic of our Western tradition, theÂ AeneidÂ of VirgilÂ (d. 19 BCE), the hero Aeneas visits Carthage on his wanderings towards Rome from his ruined, native land of Troy. Later, when Aeneas and his Trojans are battling the natives of Italy toÂ foundÂ the high walls of Rome, two Trojan warriors, Nisus and Euryalus, undertake a suicidal mission to gain great glory. As Euryalus is cut down by a swath of foes, his friend Nisus charges forward into the enemy ranks, Virgil tells us, âlaunching himself straight at the foe, through many wounds hastening a heroic death.â Virgil, the narrator, himself breaks his narrative silence and speaks to the two fallen heroes:\n\nFortunate both! If in the least my songs avail, no future day will ever take you out of the record of remembering time, while children of Aeneas make their home around the Capitoline rock, and still the Roman Father governsÂ all.[6]\n\nLooking to our Norse heritage here in America (much revived of late with neo-pagan blockbusters likeÂ theÂ ThorÂ films), we find the same idea. The oldÂ Anglo-Saxons spoke ofÂ dÅm, the glory that a warrior must attain to gain immortal remembrance. Beowulf says to his friends and followers as he volunteers to go and kill the creature Grendelâs mother, âEach of us must live to see the end of his life in this world. Let him who may labor for glory before his death.â While Beowulf battles his demonic enemy, the narrator tells us, âThus a man must do whenÂ he is bent on winning lasting praise. He will not give his life a momentâsÂ thought.â[7]Seeking a beautiful death, then, is a deeply selfish act. For glory is the mercenary key to immortality in this earthly world, and a heroic death in battle is its speediest path. As the wise woman Diotima explains in PlatoâsÂ Symposium, âDo you think that Achilles would have died for Patroclusâ¦ if [he] hadnât expected the memory of their virtueâwhich we still hold in honorâto be immortal?â[8]\nIn Islam, martyrdom is also an actÂ dyed with self-interest. The famous martyrs of Muslim history did not sacrifice themselves only for their community, for their families, or for their cause. Like the quest for immortal glory,Â Muslims seek martyrdom to cheat death. In the Quran, martyrdom is described in the language of commerce. âBehold,â God tells us in the Quran,\n\nGod has bought of the believers their lives and their possessions, promising them paradise, they fight in the path of God, slay and are slain. A promise which in truth He has willed upon Himself in the Torah, the Gospel and the Quranâ¦Â (QuranÂ 9:111)\n\nAlthough the first martyr in Islam was a womanâSumayya, tortured to death for her faithâfamous martyrs from the Prophet ï·ºâs time exemplify this self-centered desire for immediate paradise, instant immortality. During the Battle of Badr, Umayr and âAwf stand with the Prophet ï·º ready for battle. âUmayr cries, âWonder of wonders, is there nothing between me and my entering Paradise but that these men should slay me?!â âAwf asks the Prophet, âO Messenger of God, what is it that makes the Lord most high laugh with joy at His slave?âÂ The Prophet ï·º replied, âWhen he plunges without armor into the midst of the foe.â Both âUmayr and âAwf, âAwf without any armor, threw themselves at the enemy and fought until killed. When the Prophet ï·º was threatened by a troop of cavalry during the near defeat of Uhud, he asked those around him, âWho will stand up to these foes?â A man named Wahb stood forth, and the Prophet ï·º told him, âRejoice, for Paradise is yours!â Wahb plunged into the enemy ranks and, astoundingly, fought his way all the way through their body. He then turned around and entered the enemy ranks again, fighting until slain.[9]\nIn its self-centeredness, the Muslim desire for a beautiful death is similar to the thirst for glory in Greco-Roman, Norse, or modern Western culture.[10]Â But there is one hugely important difference. A Muslim martyr seeks the recognition and validation not of a bard, historian, or filmmaker, but of God Most High. The value of death in the path of God is not contingent upon human recognition. The great Japanese epicÂ The Treasury of the Loyal RetainersÂ (better known as theÂ 47 Ronin, also a 2013 film, in which 47 samurai conspire to avenge their slain master, then all commit ritual suicide)Â makes this clear. The first line of the story tells us, âThe sweetest food, if left untasted, remains unknown, its savor wasted.â[11]Â As the famousÂ JahiliÂ poet Tarafa b. al-âAbdÂ sangÂ against those who told him to be moral and honorable:\n\nI see that the graves of the thrifty man and the spendthrift wastrel look the same.[12]Â \n\nThe Japanese play and the pre-Islamic poet lay the danger out plainly: without human remembrance, glory has no resonance. It does not, as Maximus (Russell Crowe)Â saysÂ inÂ Gladiator, âecho in eternity.â\nWhile Virgil has to assure the two Trojan heroes,Â Nisus and Euryalus,Â that he will not let their glorious deaths be forgotten, Muslims need no bardâs promise, no artistâs awl. For, as the Quran tells us, God does not wrong any of His slaves. He lets no good deed go unrewarded. âAnd whoever has done a kernelâs weight of good, will see itâ on Judgment Day. A Muslim who dies for Godâs cause will win immortality even if he falls in an unknown land, in the dark of night, unsung and rejected of man. The Lord Most High will note his deed. And Godâs creation itself will sing his praise, as the Prophet ï·º tells us of the ants in the dust and the whales in the oceanÂ singing prayersÂ for those who teach goodliness in this world. Martyrs will enter paradise and their greeting will be âPeace,â all sins are pardoned, all is forgiven.\nLet us return to the real quandary we have to face, however, that knot that weâve yet to untangle. Certainly, to seek death in order to cheat it is not foreign at all in theÂ Western tradition. Muslims, too, seek immortality through a beautiful death. But what is this âpath of Godâ that the Quran speaks of, that cause for which a Muslim dies in order to become a martyr? In aÂ hadithÂ narrated by Abu Musa al-Ashâari (Sahih al-Bukhari,Â Sunan al-Tirmidhi) a man asks the Prophet ï·º, âA man might fight for protection, or fight out of courage, or fight for reputation and praise, which one of these is âin the path of Godâ?â The Prophet ï·º replies, âWhoever fights so that Godâs word might be supreme, that is in âthe path of God.ââ[13]\nSo that Godâs word might be supremeâ¦ what does that mean, what is this word that martyrs are supposed to elevate? In Islam, Godâs word is the Quran and the guidance it brings. God tells us in the Quran that He made His word become flesh in the form of Jesus and his message. Godâs word is His everlasting promise of salvation to His humble servants:\n\nNay, indeed those close to God, no fear need they have and neither shall they grieveâthose who believe and were fearful of God. Theirs is glad tidings in this world and the next. There is no changing Godâs word, that is the greatest of attainments.Â (Quran 10:62-64). Â \n\nGodâs word is the constant message of all the prophets, all the greats from the pantheon of Godâs messengers: Abraham, Moses, Noah, Jesus and Muhammad (peace be on all of them).Â Making Godâs unchanging word supreme is to hold their banner high, to lift up the oppressed, to call out for justice, to raise the poor from the depths of indigence and to make the will of the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful God, paramount.Â \nWe know that Godâs word is the light of knowledge that has always illuminated the encompassing darkness, but when we Muslims today look around us we find Godâs word used toÂ extinguish. That same phrase, âfighting to make Godâs word supreme,â is the sameÂ hadithÂ cited eerily in a voice-over commentary in a video of a suicide bomb attack on a Baghdad hotel; a voice preaches that the holy warriors are fighting âli-takun kalimat Allah hiya al-Ê¿ulyÄ, that Godâs word might be supreme.â Even in the 1970s,Â Muhammad Abd al-Salam Farag of the Jamaâat Jihad said that the purpose of his Muslim martyrs was to die fighting âso that Godâs word might be supreme.â When we Muslims try to explain to others thatÂ jihadÂ is to struggle in Godâs path, to elevate His word, we are told: what use is this amorphous and volatile notion of âelevating Godâs wordâ if it can be used to cause such mayhem and shed so much innocent blood? Muslims are told that they should dispense entirely with this notion of martyrdom in Godâs path, since it just seems to lead to the murder of both Muslim and non-Muslim civilians.\nMy response to this is simple: you could be right, dying to elevate Godâs word might be too often misused by Muslims to be useful. It might be obsolete. But, if it is obsolete, then so too are the notions of dying for glory, forÂ kleos, forÂ dom, for honor, for greatness, for duty. These are all words that have helped launch wars far bloodier, and massacres far more deracinating than even the horror we have seen in Iraq or Syria. How many men died as German tanks rolled through Europe for the âgloryâ of the Third Reich? How many people died in Nazi gas chambers because of the word âdutyâ? Consider the words of the samurai who led the famous 47 Ronin in their heroic act to avenge their lord, that ânoble purpose,â the narrator of the story tells us, âwhich will give [them] a name for loyalty and rectitude to resound through all the ages.â Listen to the words of one of these samurai:\n\nI am not unaware that [my actions] will bring extinction to my household and despair to my wife, but as a samurai I owe the service of my sword to the god of war.[14]\n\nHow many a family has been shattered by glory, by honor?Â How many a parent has seen their child butchered, and how many a child has grown up an orphan?Â And yet the words âhonor,â âglory,â and âgreatnessâ still move our hearts to nobility and the hopes of âa beautiful death.â We do not hold these concepts accountable for any misdeeds done in their name. Perhaps it is because they are so deeply etched in the long stone of our history in the West. They are the ancient ore for which our forefathers mined in search of immortal memory, and the currency for which our still pagan hearts ceaselessly yearn today.[15]Â Who would question the value of glory, of a beautiful death? Not Virgil, not Homer, not Herodotus, not Beowulfâ¦ not the greats, and not those millions who still read their words today.\nLet us Muslims, then, make dying to elevate Godâs word,Â li-takun kalimat Allah hiya al-âulya, as noble in the eyes of those around us. There were stories that, when the Virginia Tech killer went on his rampage ten years ago, a Muslim student died trying to stop the madman and save his classmates. I have no idea if this report is true, but letâs suppose it was, and that every American heard it. What a revolution that would start in the public mind and its perceptions of Muslim martyrs andÂ jihad.Â What if Muslims were known as a people who unhesitatingly sacrifice their lives to save others, to alleviate pain, to end injustice through peaceful meansâperhaps the only viable means in our day and age? What if we could make these acts the means of âmaking Godâs word supremeâ?\nThe English word âmartyrâ comes from the Greek word âto bear witness.â This is the exact same meaning as the Arabic word,Â shahÄ«d, that the Quran uses for those who die in Godâs cause. To give oneâs life for the principles of oneâs beliefâas the Jews who rose up against Roman occupation did at Masada, as Christian saints like Polycarp did in the face of crushing persecution, as Martin Luther King did, not fifty years agoâis the ultimate testimony that one can give for oneâs faith.\nWhat if Muslims restored this idea of âbearing witnessâ to the word martyrdom? What if we thought of martyrdom as bearing witness by being willing to die in the name of that God Who tells us that saving one life is like saving all of humanity, that standing up to injustice is the highest act of faith, that feeding the stranger and the orphan, and sheltering the wayfarer are the solemn duties of every individual? The Quran (41:33) tells us, âWhat better word is there than calling out to God, doing a good deed and saying, Indeed I am one of those who submits to God.â As Will Ferrellâs characterÂ understood, dying pushing a child out of the way of a bus is as poetic a deed as any, a beautiful death, for a Muslim, for an American, and there is nothing frightening or foreign about that.\n\n\n[1]Â See JalÄl al-DÄ«n al-SuyÅ«á¹­Ä«,Â AbwÄb al-saÊ¿Äda fÄ« asbÄb al-shahÄda; AbÅ« Bakr al-ÄjurrÄ«,Â á¹¢ifat al-ghurabÄâ min al-muâminÄ«nÂ (Kuwait: DÄr al-KhulafÄâ, 1983), 20, 66â68.\n\n\n[2]Â TheÂ hadithÂ isÂ al-tÄjir al-amÄ«n al-á¹£adÅ«q al-muslim maÊ¿a al-shuhadÄâ yawm al-qiyÄma.

AsÂ peopleÂ witness the synchronization of actions and purpose of millions of pilgrims,Â theyÂ experienceÂ amazement and wonderment. People often ask,Â âWhy is theÂ HajjÂ important?â or âWhat is the purpose of pilgrimage rituals in this day and age?â\nIn this paper, we discuss the power of rituals and focus on the various benefits and significance of theÂ HajjÂ ritualsÂ in particular. In the course of this discussion, we embark on a whirlwind tour of relevant material from anthropology, psychology, theology, jurisprudence, exegesis, philosophy, andâmost importantlyâIslamic spirituality.\nWhy Do Rituals Exist?\nIn the modern world,Â religiousÂ rituals are seen only as vestiges of the DarkÂ Ages which society has outgrown in light of modern industrialization. For many, material profit is the paramount virtue, and the only worthy goal of human behavior. Such a narrative portrays ritual practices as irrational behaviorsÂ thatÂ do not provide tangible value, and whose goals can be better achieved through economic and technological advancement.\nAccording to Catherine Bell, âThe popular contention that ritual and religion decline in proportion to modernization has been something of a sociological truism since the mid-19th century.â[1]Â This conventional wisdom setsÂ the idea of ritual in direct opposition to reason itself. As Schilbrack described, âwhile primitive minds need ritual to calm their fears and makeÂ âsenseâÂ of what was not really understood, with the maturation of reason and the development of modern science we have naturally dropped those practices.â[2]\nAs rituals did not relate to matters that could be examined within the realm of the physical world, they were seen as unbefitting any rational educated person. Ritual was also perceived as irrational due to its disinterest in material goods. The very notion of expending resources such as money, time,Â andÂ energy without receiving material return was seen as a mindless and backward practice.[3]\nHowever, academics have come to recognize this as a simple-minded caricature of the value and relevance of rituals. Since the mid-twentieth century, this âsecularization thesisâ has been rejected by a growing number of sociologists who point to the fundamental functionÂ ofÂ ritual in all aspects of human life. Rituals are increasingly seen as inherent to human behavior, changing yet constantly present in the human experience.\n\nAll societies are equally ritualized; they merely practice different rituals. If most people in industrialized societies no longer go to church regularly or practice elaborate rituals of initiation, this does not mean that ritual has declined. All that has happened is that new types of ritualâpolitical, sporting, musical, medical, academic and so onâhave taken place of the traditional ones.[4]\n\nIndeed, rituals are embedded in every society and manifest not only in religious practices but within social, political,Â and even mundane daily activities. Consider one of the most ubiquitous ritualsâthe handshake. What does it represent? An ancient custom that perhaps originated as an act to demonstrate the absence of concealed weapons, this gesture has come to symbolize a mutual acknowledgment of courtesy, welcome, respect, dignity, trust, non-confrontation,Â and peace. These cognitive and emotional states are collectively bound up in a single human gesture.\nWe can find rituals almost anywhere we look: rallies, marches, festivities, celebrations, coronations, inaugurations, etc. In civic life, ritual ceremonies continue to be performed for marriages and funerals, the abandonment of which would seem to deprecate the significance of theseÂ life eventsÂ entirely. Whether it be by exchanging gifts, expressing complimentsÂ orÂ condolences, entertaining guests, visiting relatives, working only on weekdays, or singing nursery rhymes to children, we see how ritualsÂ continue toÂ play a prominent role within nearly all human activity.\nThe reason rituals matter, and why they remain central to human activity, is because they transcend verbal communication. They allow humans to express a shared sentiment of meaning and value. They provide a language that is incredibly versatile, which allows mutual recognition of the significance of a particular event, entity or relationship. As Bell notes, ârather than ritual as the vehicle for theÂ expressionÂ of authority, practice theorists tend to explore how ritual is a vehicle for theÂ constructionÂ of relationships of authority and submission.â[5]Â \nSchilbrack, building off the work of Pierre Bourdieu, likens rituals to social âcalls to orderâ which âawaken deeply buried corporeal dispositions.â[6]Â Rituals are thus likened to acts of protests, wherein the ritual itself, through the process of gathering and chanting, can rekindle or regenerate feelings and emotions within the participants.\nFor this reason, rituals will always remain a significant part of our collective lives. The ability to construct purpose and meaning, to change or touch deep emotions, is a power that cannot be replaced within the human experience.\nRituals In The Spiritual Realm\nRituals that pertain to spirituality demonstrate the greatest potency in constructing meaning and awakening deep emotional statesÂ inÂ those who participate. Through the use of ritual, weÂ attempt toÂ articulate the ineffable.Â Rituals allow usÂ to condense vast arrays of meaning, spectrums of emotion, notions of virtue,Â all into the span ofÂ oftenÂ momentary gestures. That which challenges the boundaries of our human experience and transcends the limitations of our verbal communication is accessed and expressed via spiritual practice and religious ritual.\nReturning to the modernÂ descriptionÂ of rituals as irrational, we now recognize that this short-sighted perception stems, predominantly, from an inability to see beyond the physical movementsÂ and motor behaviorÂ involved in a ritual, while remaining oblivious to the metaphysical significance ofÂ the actsÂ being performed. The Qurâan addresses this head-on when discussing the ritual sacrifice of an animal: âTheir meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from youâ.[7]Â The physical action is but the external shell of what is a spiritual exercise aimed at achieving nearness to God through the symbolic language of sacrifice: giving up what is dear to oneself (wealth/property/time/effort) to express oneâs love for the Divine and oneâs submission to HisÂ will. The outward actions are actually symbolsÂ forÂ what is on the inside.Â In fact, Allah describes rituals as symbols of our spirituality in the Qurâan: âAnd whoever honors the symbols of Allahâindeed, it is from the piety of hearts.â[8]\nConversely, the exact same physical action could be performed, but when unaccompanied by the required spiritual state, motivation andÂ intention, it may fail to achieve the status of acceptable worship (Qabool). Consider these twoÂ statementsÂ of the Prophet MuhammadÂ ï·º:Â âWhoever does not abandon false speech and bad behavior, God has no need of their abandonment of food and drink (in fasting),â[9]Â and âIt may be that someone fasts the entire day andÂ gainsÂ nothing from it but hunger, and it may be that someone stands the night in prayer andÂ gainsÂ nothing from it but lack of sleep.â[10]\nA key feature of rituals seems to be their recurring nature. But repetition does not diminish significance or meaningfulness. How many times does one say to their spouse, âI love youâ? In spite of repetition, these words never lose their meaning or strength, ratherÂ theyÂ intensify. Thus it is with our expressions of love for God, our prayers, our supplications, our statements of âAll praise belongs to Allah,â and âGlory be to Allah,â and so forth. These actions when performed with mindfulness and reflection strengthen our spirituality and allow us to ascend to higher levels of love and conviction.\nThough they areÂ supra-rational, ritual practices are prescribed with explicitly rational ends in mindâthe spiritual elevation and felicity of humankind in this life and the next. On the other hand, Muslims are forbidden from rituals that areÂ anti-rational/irrational;Â i.e.,Â rituals that do not make sense in either the natural or spiritual realm. In the case of the former, nonsensical rituals appeal to superstitious notions about how the natural world operates. The Prophet MuhammadÂ ï·ºÂ told his companions that eclipses are not a consequence of the birth or death of any individual.Â Spiritually irrational ritualsÂ make claims about what the Divine has ordained that are unsubstantiated by scriptural evidence (see for instance verses 6:138 and 5:103Â which describe rituals of the paganÂ Arabs related to designating certain animals to be prohibited for use because of superstitious customs; God concludes the latter verse stating âmost of them do not use their reason,â therebyÂ establishing that ritual practices should not be anti-rational).\nPurpose of Islamic Rituals\nIslamic rituals, orÂ âIbadat, remain a subject of great interest amongst Muslim theologians and jurists. However, most Islamic scholarship is concerned with the functionality of Islamic rituals rather thanÂ theirÂ purpose. Jurists focus on the categorization of rituals as well as the legality of form, while theologians are concerned primarily withÂ theirÂ connection to theological principles.\nThis does not mean that the underlying purpose ofÂ âIbadatÂ is unimportant or unaddressed, but rather that it seems to be a muted conversation, likely due to the lack of controversyÂ aroundÂ it. Recognizing the relative scarcity of writing on this topic, some of the works in the field ofÂ tazkiyya al-nafsÂ (purification of the soul) have endeavored to highlight the underlying ethos of what Islamic worship is all about.\nIndeed, the purpose which drives Islamic rituals is important as we reflect over the specific rituals of theÂ HajjÂ and particularly as we consider the emotions theÂ HajjÂ experience seeks to awaken within the believer.\nâIbadatÂ is derived from the wordÂ âabd, meaning servant or slave. According toÂ Lisan al-âArab,Â âabdÂ is rooted in the meaning of humility or subservience and this is likened to the ancient Arabic phrase ofÂ al-tareeq al-maâbad, or the path which is an &#8216;abd, denoting a path that is well-traveled and flattened due to excessive passage upon it.[11]\nIt is through these meanings that Muslim scholars understood the concepts ofÂ âUbudiyaÂ (servitude) andÂ âIbadatÂ (rituals), all derived from the same root word (âabd). After all, God could have used different terminology to describe religiosity and devotion yet specifically chose to define the relationship between God and believer through derivatives of the wordÂ âabd.\nIbn Taymiyyah (d.Â 728Â H) comments on this by explaining that,\n\nRitualized devotion (âIbadah) is the convention of fulfillment of oneâs love of the Divine, paired with the fulfillment of oneâs humility towards the Divine. The âabd is then the humbled lover (of God).[12]Â \n\nIbn al-Qayyim (d.Â 751Â H) expounded on this definition stating that,\n\nRitualized devotion (âIbadah) is the highest station of love. It is a popular saying that:Â âLove has enslaved him (âabdahu) as though he is propertyâÂ and this is the true love of the Divine.[13]\n\nInÂ bothÂ definitions, we can see clearly how Islamic scholars tied the idea of ritualsÂ toÂ the realization of human emotions.Â In this sense, the form ofÂ aÂ ritual is not fully meaningful without it awakening the necessary emotions (namely loveÂ of,Â and humilityÂ before,Â God).\nIn fact, as Abu Hilal Al-Askari (d.Â 395Â H) noted, âthere are no rituals (âIbadah) except through knowing the Divine,â[14]Â meaning rituals lack spirit or substanceÂ withoutÂ an emotional connection and an imagination of theÂ Divine. Thus every Islamic ritual (âIbadah), be it prayer, fasting, charity orÂ Hajj, seeks to create and awaken deep emotions within theÂ practitioner.Â It is important to also remember that even when our worship may fall short of experiencing that heartful presence (Hudur al-Qalb), it still retains merit with God because we are doing our best to strive to reach that level.\nIslamic rituals are also symbolic in nature. When MuslimÂ jurists differed over the particular form or physical pose in theÂ SalahÂ (daily prayer) ritual, in the absence of explicit scripture,Â theyÂ would typically rely on whichever pose was seen as denoting greater humility towards theÂ Divine. This is because Muslim scholars understood that every ritualÂ hasÂ symbolic meanings underlying each act.\nIn effect, ourÂ SalahÂ is the language of the body just as ourÂ TasbeehÂ (declaring the glory of God) is the language of our tongue. When we fall prostrate inÂ SujudÂ we are verbalizing with our bodies the affirmation of His Divine Lordship and Oneness, just as we verbalize it on our tongues with theÂ ShahadahÂ (testimony of faith).\nHajj: Abrahamâs Legacy\nIn the Qurâan, AbrahamÂ (peace be upon him)Â is repeatedly referenced as the central figure in theÂ HajjÂ story. Abraham is described as being guided to the place of the House (i.e., theÂ Kaâbah) in Makkah,[15]Â as well as the builder of the Kaâbah along with his son Ishmael (the patriarch of the Makkan Arabs).[16]Â In theÂ hadithÂ literature, the rituals ofÂ HajjÂ are explicitly referred to asÂ âa legacy from the legacies of Abraham (irth Ibrahim)â.[17]Â \nUnderstanding the life ofÂ Â Abraham plays a powerful role in understanding the rituals ofÂ Hajj. Through these rituals, pilgrims are able to connect themselves to a shared history and to the legacy of Abraham and his family.\nFor this reason, even the pre-Islamic Arabs practiced theÂ Hajj, despite departing from Abrahamâs monotheism. TheÂ HajjÂ connected them to their forefathers (Abraham and Ishmael) even as they embraced polytheism which contradicted the basis of Abrahamâs message.\nYet this represents one of the greater overarching goals of the HajjÂ rituals:Â the ability to connect to a shared history, narrative,Â and community.Â Through the motions and rites ofÂ HajjÂ the believer takes a step back from their specific moment in time and appreciates the larger tradition that binds them to billions of people throughout history.\nPart of the unique story ofÂ HajjÂ presented in the Qurâan is that Abraham was the first man tasked to proclaim the duty ofÂ HajjÂ to others.[18]Â Yet, Abraham is also largely presented in the Qurâan as a man with nearly no followers besides his own immediate family. The Qurâan refers to Abraham as a ânation unto himself,â referencing his isolation.[19]Â \nYet the Abrahamic call forÂ HajjÂ isÂ somehowÂ answered generations afterwards, with millions of people from every corner of the world striving to follow his footsteps. It represents a message of hope, optimism,Â andÂ trust in God andÂ revealsÂ how the most unlikely outcomes can be achieved with Godâs Will.\nTheÂ HajjÂ also represents the ability to connect to a larger nation and community. That millions of people,Â male and female,Â past and present, from differing races, ethnicities, and ages can synchronize rites and rituals, driven by common purpose, provides the pilgrim with a powerful experience of shared brotherhood and kinship that cannot be experienced otherwise.\nPerhaps most noteworthy in this regard is the testimony of Malcolm X, who was widely knownÂ forÂ his anti-White rhetoricÂ (due to his experiencesÂ in racially segregated America), yet renounced most of that rhetoric after experiencing theÂ Hajj. He commonly spoke of being changed by Makkah and described the transformative nature of theÂ HajjÂ through his letter from the pilgrimage:\n\nThere were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. They were of all colors, from blue-eyed blondes to black-skinned Africans. But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and the non-white&#8230;.\nDuring the past eleven days here in the Muslim world, I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass,Â and slept in the same bed (or on the same rug)âwhile praying to the same God with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of the blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white. And in the words and in the actions and in the deeds of the âwhite&#8217; Muslims, I felt the same sincerity that I felt among the black African Muslims of Nigeria, Sudan and Ghana. We are truly all the sameâbrothers.[20]\n\nThis beautifully illustrates how theÂ HajjÂ rituals tap into deep human emotions and provide the opportunity to transform behavior towards the positive. They connect us to a purpose larger than ourselves, to a community larger than our own, and to a legacy and history of greatness: the legacy of Abraham.\nThe Symbolism Of TheÂ HajjÂ Rituals\nAs we have previously discussed, Islamic rituals are not aimless in purpose but rather seek to evoke emotions in the heartsÂ of believers. The rites and rituals ofÂ HajjÂ are no exception to this purpose. In fact, the Qurâan specifies the goal ofÂ âincliningÂ heartsâ (i.e.,Â emotions and passions) through the mechanism ofÂ Hajj. This is mentioned in the prayer of Abraham, which is then fulfilled by God through the commandment ofÂ Hajj:\n\nOur Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful.[21]\n\nThis is referred to once again when the Qurâan references the rites of slaughter: âTheir meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you.â[22]Â \nThus, by examining each rite and ritual ofÂ HajjÂ we are able to uncover the spiritual meanings intended by each practice. We begin to understand how each ritual embodies meanings which transcend the capacities ofÂ verbalÂ expression and connects the participant to a richness of spirituality, tradition, and community.\nThe Symbolism ofÂ Tawaf\nTawafÂ (lit. circling) is the ritual of circling the Kaâbah (House of God) seven times during theÂ HajjÂ (pilgrimage) orÂ UmrahÂ (lesser pilgrimage). TheÂ TawafÂ is the ritual most associated with theÂ Hajj, providing the iconic image of millions of people circling the Kaâbah in Makkah.\nThe Kaâbah is said to be the first house built on earth to worship God, the very first sanctuary devoted solely to glorify our Creator.[23]Â The Qurâan refers to the Kaâbah as a âMathabahÂ (lit. place of retreat or resort) for mankindâ and as âthe Houseâ (i.e., the House of God).[24]Â In this sense, being in the presence of the Kaâbah provides its own spiritual benefit, allowing believersÂ to recharge and rekindle their sense of faith and connection to God.\nIt is important to remember that there is nothing inherently sacred about bricks, mortar, or cloth, and many non-Muslims have the misconceptions that Muslims worship the Kaâbah. In reality, what is important is what the Kaâbah representsâtheÂ qiblahÂ or direction Muslims face in their prayers to God. Muslims used to pray towards Masjid al-Aqsa in Jerusalem during the first phase of Prophet Muhammad ï·ºâs preaching. When theÂ qiblahÂ was changed from Masjid al-Aqsa to the Kaâbah, God revealed an important reminder in the Qurâan that physical directions and physical structures are notÂ intrinsically sacred. Rather, their sanctity comes from God assigning significance to them and imbuing them with meaning:\n\nRighteousness is not about turning your faces toward the east or the west, but rather true righteousness is about oneâs faith in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets. And itâs about giving oneâs wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask for help, and for freeing slaves; itâs about establishing prayer and giving zakat in charity and being those who fulfill their promise when they promise and who are patient in poverty and hardship and times of peril. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.[25]\n\nSimilarly, kissing the Black Stone duringÂ TawafÂ is a symbolic act of penitence and repentance.[26]Â It is related that Umar ibn al-Khattab kissed the stone and said, âBy Allah, I know that you are nothingÂ but a stone and if I had not seen Allah&#8217;s Messenger ï·º kissing you, I would not have kissed you.â[27]\nThe act ofÂ TawafÂ reminds believers that God should be at the center of our lives, just as the Kaâbah remains the center of the ritual. It is an act of submission and subservience that recognizes that though believers have willingly placed God as the central point of their devotion, our entire existence revolves around God, whether we recognize it or not.\nThe Symbolism ofÂ Saâi\nSaâiÂ (lit. seeking, searching) is the ritual of walking between the two hills (Al-SafaÂ andÂ Al-Marwa). This ritual commemorates the story of Hajar and her son Ishmael. The two were left in a barren desert by Abraham, under the instruction of God. Hajar reportedly called out to Abraham, questioning him on why he was abandoning her and their infant son in an empty desert. Abraham would not respond until she asked him, âHas God ordered you to do this?â He replied affirmatively and she replied with full conviction in God, âIn that case, He will not abandon us.âÂ [28]\nHajar returned to her infant son and, as the baby cried from hunger, she began running betweenÂ Al-SafaÂ andÂ Al-Marwa, searching for anything or anyone who might be able to help them. Hajar ran between the two mountains seven times in desperation. She then witnessed the Archangel Gabriel at the feet of her baby, who struck his heel into the ground, causing a spring of water to gush forth known asÂ Zamzam.[29]Â Later, tribesmen from the tribe of Jurhum came and settled in the area, respectfully taking permission from Hajar to make use ofÂ the water ofÂ Zamzam, and in this manner, the city of Makkah came into existence.\nHere is where theÂ HajjÂ ritual ofÂ SaâiÂ was born and Hajarâs story is pivotal in understanding the narrative ofÂ Hajj. Her story is one of utmost devotion, conviction, certitude, and trust in God, above all else. That a mother would be willing to accept the fate of being abandoned in a barren desert with her breastfeeding child, because she was certain it was the desire of God, displays the greatest example of trusting in God.\nHer running between the mountains, as emulated by pilgrims to this day, reminds us of the desperation and need we all have for the aid of God. As an unnamed Muslim scholar said:Â Â &#8220;Know that the one who is stranded at sea, clinging to a board, and tossed and turned by its waves,Â is not in any greater need of God than you.&#8221; It revives the metaphysical awareness that without the constant support of God, we would be worse off than stranded at sea or in the middle of a barren desert.\nHajarâs example is also cherished for her unbridled optimism and hope in God and in His promise. As the pilgrimsÂ run through the mountains, they recognize Hajarâs unwavering optimism despite the arduous struggle she was enduring. It reminds believersÂ that no matter the magnitude of hardship they face, they should continue to be hopeful in striving and seeking a solution.Â Hajar knewÂ that Godâs sustenance wouldÂ comeÂ to those who seekÂ itÂ and struggle for it.\nThere is something most fascinating about theÂ SaâiÂ ritual and what it represents. In a way, this is the ritual at the root of Islamâs ancestry, representing the very origin story of Makkah itself. All the other rituals commemorate events that occurred after HajarâsÂ SaâiÂ in the desert. What is truly remarkable about this ritual is the person we emulate.Â Through it weÂ commemorate the faith in God held by Hajarâa woman, originally a slave girl from Egypt, possessingÂ noÂ status, fame, or wealth. And yet, her devotion to God was so beloved to Him that He established it as an eternal ritual to be followed by people all over the world.Â A righteous woman, in whose footsteps millions of men are commanded to walk. As theÂ hadithÂ states, âThat was your mother, O children of the Heavenly water.â[30]\nTheÂ SaâiÂ represents a rich tradition. It is truly remarkable that for thousands of years, men and women have emulated the steps of a woman of common birth, displaying that the virtueÂ ofÂ humanity is in their emotional connection to, and physical sacrifice for, the Divine.\nThe Symbolism ofÂ âArafah\nâArafahÂ is the name of a mountain range, along with the surrounding plains, just east of Makkah.Â Yawm âArafahÂ (the day ofÂ âArafah) is the 9th day of Dhul Hijjah in the Islamic calendar. OnÂ Yawm âArafahÂ pilgrims all gather on the plains and mount ofÂ âArafahÂ and spend the day, until sunset, beseeching God for forgiveness.\nTheÂ HajjÂ rites and rituals typically have windows of time during which they must be completed. The gathering atÂ âArafah, on the day ofÂ âArafah, is the one ritual which gathers all pilgrims in the same exact place and at the same exact time, performing the same rites. In fact, the ProphetÂ ï·ºÂ is reported to have said âHajjÂ isÂ âArafah,â[31]Â meaning it is the ritual which is paramount in theÂ HajjÂ experience.\nYawm âArafahÂ holds certain significance in the Islamic tradition. First, it is the day on which God revealed verse 5:3 which proclaims the perfection of the Islamic tradition and the finality of religious laws that would be revealed to mankind. Second, it is known as the day of the covenant. This refers to a prior existence or consciousness during which God took an oath from every soul. This incident is referenced in the Qurâan:\n\nAnd [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adamâfrom their loinsâtheir descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], &#8220;Am I not your Lord?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, we have testified.&#8221; [This]âlest you should say on the day of Resurrection, &#8220;Indeed, we were of this unaware.&#8221;Â [32]\n\nFinally, it is a day marked by forgiveness and Godâs pleasure. In one tradition, the Prophet ï·º is reported to have said: âThere is no day on which God frees more servants from the fire than the day ofÂ âArafah.â[33]Â In another tradition, he said: âGod boasts to the angels about the people ofÂ âArafah, (saying):Â Look at My Servants, they have come to Me in the morning in a desolate state, with dusty hair, having crossed every deep valley. I call you to witness that I have forgiven them.â[34]\nJust asÂ âArafahÂ is known as the day of the covenant, in reference to a day preceding the birth of mankind in our current existence,Â âArafahÂ also ignites the imagination of the believer towards the afterlife and the day of resurrection.\nThe day of resurrection has a number of epithets in the Qurâan, including the day of accounting (yawm al-Hisab),[35]Â the day of disaster (yawmun âAqeem),[36]Â the day of distress (yawm al-Hasrah). But many of the names of the Final DayÂ bearÂ a striking similarity to the day ofÂ âArafah. These include the Day of Standing (yawm al-Qiyamah),[37]Â the day of being brought out (yawm al-Khurooj),[38]Â and the day of meeting (yawm al-Talaaq).[39]\nWhen the pilgrim witnesses so many people gathered in one place, at one time, desperately pining for the grace of God, it inevitably evokes images of the day of resurrection. The clothing ofÂ HajjÂ is also marked by simple white sheets, analogous to the shrouds used to wrap the dead. All of these elements combine to make the day ofÂ âArafahÂ a compelling reminder of our mortality and our eventual resurrection. It reminds the pilgrim of their eventual standing before God, answering for their deeds.\nThe Symbolism ofÂ Udhiya\nTheÂ UdhiyaÂ refers to the ritual sacrifice of an animal that is performed during theÂ HajjÂ season on or after the day ofÂ Eid al-AdhaÂ (the festival of the sacrifice).[40]Â This is one of two annual celebrations for Muslims around the world.[41]Â The Prophet MuhammadÂ ï·ºÂ instructed that the animal being sacrificed must be slaughtered in a humane manner, minimizing any pain and avoiding even making the animal feel anxious.[42]Â The sacrifice is an act of gratitude and devotion to God, and an act of generosity towards others as the meat of the animal is distributed to the poor and needy.\nThus, we find the humanitarian spirit of Islam emphasized on the day ofÂ Eid al-Adha. As Muslims celebrate this day with their families, they share their blessings with others, as God states in the Qurâan that theÂ HajjÂ rituals were prescribed âso they may experience several forms of benefit, and exalt Godâs name during the appointed days over the cattle which God has provided for them. So eat of them and feed the destitute and poor.â[43]Â The emphasis on the humanitarian benefit is repeated only a few verses later, âWhen the animals have been sacrificed, then eat from them and feed the needy and the beggar. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may be grateful.â[44]Â In the spirit of serving all humanity, the meat is donated to the poor regardless of religious background.[45]Â The Prophet MuhammadÂ ï·ºÂ taught, âDonate in charity to people of all faiths.â[46]\nThe origin of this ritual is one of the most famous stories about Abraham, the story about being commanded by God to sacrifice his son.[47]Â It is a story that lies at the heart of each of the religious traditions that look to Abraham as their spiritual forefather. But it is also a story that has been subjected to much polemical use. New Atheist pundits like Christopher Hitchens famously attacked this story as the prime example of what is wrong with religion. What kind of God would command a father to kill his own son? What kind of father would agree to perform such an act? And what kind of religion would venerate a man who agreed to kill his own son because he believed God instructed it?\nReflecting on these objections is imperative: to ensure that we have correctly understood the story ourselves and are able to properly represent its lessons to others, and also to see why these objections misrepresent the story. To be sure, what was asked of Abraham was a tremendous test of devotion. When Abraham migrated for the sake of God, abandoning his home, his belongings, having nothing but his faith in God, he prayed, âMy Lord, grant me a child from the righteous,â to which God states, âSo We gave him the glad tidings of a gentle son.â[48]Â We can only imagine the immense love Abraham had for Ishmael, which continued to grow day by day, as Ishmael grew into a little boy, till he reached the age when he could walk behind his father. And thatâs precisely when the most difficult commandment cameÂ âthe request to sacrifice that which was most beloved to him.\nWhen we examine the matter closely, we find that there are several key features of the Islamic narrative of Abrahamâs sacrifice that demonstrate why misgivings about the ethical import of the story are misplaced. A central tenet of Islamic theology explains why there is no tension in this story between doing what is good for creation (ethics) and doing what God wills (religion): at the basis of Islamic theology is the notion that Allah is the Most Merciful, and that Allah would never ordain suffering or harm for any human being, âVerily, God does not will oppression for any of His creation.â[49]Â \nThe profound reality that critics of this story cannot fathom is Abrahamâs certitude that no matter how intensely and immensely he loved Ishmael, Godâs love for Ishmael was infinitely greater. Indeed, as the Prophet MuhammadÂ ï·ºÂ described, God loves humanity more than a mother loves her own child.[50]Â Abraham knew that following the commandments of Allah would never lead to harm, and somehow, in the end, the results would be good even if he did not understand how. This is the epistemic aspect that critics neglect; the fact that Abrahamâas a prophetâpossessed certain knowledge of what God was commanding[51]Â and certain knowledge that Godâs Will is moral and good, explains why he knew that following Godâs instruction would not result in an evil outcome.[52]Â This is not some random individual claiming to have been spoken to by Godâthis is Abraham who emerged unscathed from the blazing pit of fire into which his people threw him,[53]Â Abraham who witnessed with his own eyes the physical miracle of resurrection,[54]Â and witnessed the secrets of the heavens and the earth in order to be amongst those with unparalleled certitude.[55]\nSecondly, a unique feature of the Qurâanic narrative is that Abraham actually approaches his son and speaks to him about the matter: âO my dear son, verily I have seen in my vision that I am to sacrifice you, what is your perspective on this matter?â Ishmael replies to him, âO my father, do as you have been commanded, you will find meâGod willingâto be amongst the patient.â[56]Â Ishmael enters into the matter willingly and devoutly, rather than being led to the sacrifice while oblivious to Abrahamâs intentions. There is no concealment or coercion in the Islamic narrative. This story is about the beauty of father and son both dutifully trusting in Godâs will, as the Qurâan states, âAnd then when they had both surrendered to God and he laid [Ishmael] in prostration, We called out, âO Abraham, you have fulfilled the vision, thus do we reward the doers of good.â[57]\nThe Danish existentialist philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard (d. 1855 CE), was fascinated by the apparent dilemma between faith and morality in the story of Abraham. Kierkegaard felt that this story epitomized the true meaning of faith, and he felt that many Christians had failed to appreciate the profundity of it. He dedicated his philosophical workÂ Fear and TremblingÂ to the story of Abraham&#8217;s sacrifice, focusing psychologically on the anxiety that he must have felt while going through this experience with his beloved son. Although it represents a complex work with many interpretations, a central theme that emerges from his work is the idea that Abraham at no point was committed to doing something unethical, such as murder. Rather, Abraham knew that even though what was being askedÂ seemedÂ immoral, since God would never order something that was truly immoral it meant trusting that the ultimate result would be something morally good. Thus, Abraham took a leap of faith (which Kierkegaard termed a âteleological suspension of the ethicalâ) in trusting that God would spare his son.[58]Â In this manner, Kierkegaard distinguishes between a kind of blind obedience that would entail being comfortable performing an unethical deed, versus the true faith which entails maintaining oneâs ethical concerns but trusting that ultimately good will come about in following what is known with certainty to be from God.\nThe famous Qurâanic exegete, Imam al-Shawkani (d.1250H) makes an interesting comment in this regard. He states,\n\nWhen Abraham positioned Ishmael for the sacrifice, a call from the direction of the Mountain informed him, âO Abraham you have fulfilled the vision,â thus making his fulfillment based solely on his firm resolve (to perform the deed) despite not actually performing the sacrifice. Thatâs because he went as far as he could, and what was intended was just for both of them (Abraham and Ishmael) to surrender and submit to God (not the specific act of ritual slaughter), which they successfully performed.[59]\n\nIn sum, according to this narrative, Abrahamâs response was not saying, âIâm okay with killing my child because God said so,â as the New Atheist caricature suggests, but rather it was, âGod is asking me to do something tremendously difficult, but I trust in God knowing that if I follow this path, God will be there for Ishmael and I, and God will protect us from harm. God will accept our devotion and trust in Him and lead us to something better.â This form of trust is in some sense analogous to the notorious âtrust fallâ exercise where someone allows himself or herself to fall backwards, trusting the other participant to catch them. Such a person knows that falling is bad and does not desire to hit the ground and injure themselves, but rather they demonstrate their total trust that the other participant will rescue them from harm before they make impact with the ground.\nTherefore, viewed in its proper light, this story represents a most brilliant and powerful testament to true spirituality and devotion. Though God does not ask us to sacrifice our children, life will bring many difficult challenges where it takes a lot to stand up for what is right, to be willing to endure suffering to bring about positive change. We may lose our wealth, our family, or even more. True faith does notÂ mean discarding oneâs moral values or ethics in favor of a mindless commitment to arbitrary instructions. Rather true faith means being prepared to depart with whatever our hearts may hold dear, to sacrifice that which is most precious to us, when we know we can seize an opportunity to do what is right for the sake of God and to serve His creation. Because, in the end, we know that God will be with those who strive to do good in His path.[60]\nThe Symbolism ofÂ Jamarat\nJamaratÂ (lit. pl.Â the place of pebbles) refers to three specific places in Mina, near Makkah. Pilgrims visit theÂ JamaratÂ during theÂ HajjÂ and pelt the threeÂ JamaratÂ pillars with pebbles.\nAccording to one narration, this ritual is said to commemorate the actions of Abraham while he wasÂ enÂ route to sacrifice his son Ishmael, to fulfill the instruction of God. After Abraham was convinced that slaughtering Ishmael was the will of God, on his way to his son he was confronted three times by the devil who attempted to dissuadeÂ him. And each time Abraham responded by pelting him with stones.[61]\nDespite the frequent misconception on the part of some pilgrims that they are physically pelting Satan when they throw stones at theÂ Jamarat, this is actually aÂ symbolicÂ exercise that commemorates the actions of Abraham. This exercise reminds the pilgrim to be conscious of both the internal and external evils in the world that seek to tempt us away from God and away from righteousness. And it reminds us that faith and sincerity will always be accosted and confronted by external forces, and therefore the believer should be prepared to struggle when seeking to attain the pleasure of God.\nConclusion\nAs humans, we strive to grow morally and spiritually, and reach our full potential while struggling against the arduous trials and tribulations thatÂ befallÂ us. Through the symbolic language of rituals, we discover a layer of meaning in our lives that speaks to our core sense of self: who we are, where we have come from, and for what purpose we exist. The greatest journey is the spiritual journey towards God, to achieve knowledge of Our Creator and experience Him in our lives, and the physical journey of theÂ HajjÂ encapsulates many powerful rituals that awaken us to our relationship with the Divine and with one another.\n\n\n[1]Â Bell, C.

A narration from Ibn Abbas states that the foundations were already present before. Moreover, the Prophet Muhammad ï·º stated that the time between the construction of the Kaâbah and Bayt al-Maqdis was 40 years (Sahih BukhariÂ 3186), which doesnât correspond to the time between Abraham and Solomon (i.e., thousands of years), and on the basis of this point, Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 597 H) suggested that both were actually originally constructed by Prophet Adam, 40 years apart. Ibn Hajar al-âAsqalani (d. 852 H) cites and supports this conclusion and lists a number of evidences and arguments that indicate that the Kaâbah was first built by Prophet Adam himself. He cites a report from Qatadah ibn Diâamah (d. 117 H) that states, âAllah founded the Kaâbah with Adam when he descended. Adam missed the voices of the Angels and theirÂ tasbeeh. So Allah said, âO Adam I have designated a House around which humanity will makeÂ tawafÂ just asÂ tawafÂ is performedÂ around my Throne, so journey to it.â (See Ibn Hajar,Â Fath al-Bari, Cairo: Dar al-Rayan lâil-Turath, 1987. vol. 6 p. 467, 470-1).\n\n\n[24]Â Quran, 2:125.\n\n\n[25]Â Quran, 2:177.\n\n\n[26]Â The Black Stone marks the eastern corner of the Kaâba, and is said to be a stone from Paradise sent down to Earth and blackened with the sins of mankind (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 877). There is also a weak narration attributed to Ibn Abbas which states, âThe Black Stone is (a symbol of) Godâs right Hand on Earth, so whoever greets it and kisses it, it is as if they have greeted God and kissed His Handâ (Ibn Adi,Â al-KamilÂ 1/336). Ibn Qutaybah al-Daynuri (d. 276 H) states, âThis is just an analogy, the basis of which is that when one greets a king, one kisses his hand, so it is as if the Black Stone has the station of the right hand of The Kingâ (Ibn Qutaybah,Â Taâwil Mukhtalif al-Hadith, Cairo: Dar Ibn Affan, p. 406). He also mentions a report from Aisha (ra) that when God took the primordial covenant from humanity, He placed that in the Black Stone (jaâala dhalika fiâl-hajar al-aswad). Thus, the symbolic significance may also extended to humanity renewing their covenant with God when kissing the Black Stone.\n\n\n[27]Â Sahih Muslim, 1270.\n\n\n[28]Â Sahih Al-Bukhari, 3364.\n\n\n[29]Â Ibid.\n\n\n[30]Â Sahih Bukhari, 3179. This expression highlights Hajarâs importance to theÂ ummahÂ (followers) of Prophet MuhammadÂ ï·º, and it has diverse interpretations. One possibility is that it indicates that thisÂ ummahÂ was born out at that moment of Godâs answering Hajar with theÂ spring ofÂ Zamzam.\n\n\n[31]Â Abu Dawud, 1949.\n\n\n[32]Â Quran, 7:172.\n\n\n[33]Â Sahih Muslim, 1348.\n\n\n[34]Â Al-Thahabi,Â Mizan Al-Iâtidad, 4:381.\n\n\n[35]Â Quran, 38:16.\n\n\n[36]Â Quran, 22:55.\n\n\n[37]Â Quran, 2:85.\n\n\n[38]Â Quran, 50:42.\n\n\n[39]Â Quran, 40:15\n\n\n[40]Â There is a classical difference of opinion over whether it is an obligation (Hanafi school of law) or an emphasized recommendation (Shafiâi, Maliki, Hanbali schools), and also a difference of opinion over whether it is prescribed for everyone (Shafiâi), only for non-travelers (Hanafi), or only for non-pilgrims (Maliki), along with other positions in between.\n\n\n[41]Â The other beingÂ Eid al-FitrÂ (festival of ending fasting) which follows the month of Ramadan.\n\n\n[42]Â The Prophet ï·º said, âWhen you slaughter, you should use a good method, for one of you should sharpen his knife, and give the animal as little pain as possibleâ (Sahih MuslimÂ 1955).\n\n\n[43]Â Quran, 22:28.\n\n\n[44]Â Quran, 22:36.\n\n\n[45]Â Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (d. 620 H),Â al-MughniÂ (Riyadh: Dar Alam al-Kutub 1999) vol. 13, p. 381.\n\n\n[46]Â Musannaf ibn Abi Shaybah, 10494.\n\n\n[47]Â In the Islamic tradition, the son is identified as Ishmael according to the predominant opinion amongst scholars based on indications in the Qurâan, as articulated by Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) inÂ Majmu al-FatawaÂ (Dar al-Wafaâ 2001, vol 4, p. 204). Meanwhile, exegetes like Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (d.320H) and al-Qurtubi (d.671H) supported the viewpoint that it was Isaac (see their respective commentaries on 37:101-2).\n\n\n[48]Â Quran, 37:100-101.\n\n\n[49]Â Quran, 3:108.\n\n\n[50]Â Sahih Bukhari, 5999.\n\n\n[51]Â It has been stated inÂ Tafsir al-QurtubiÂ (37:102) that he witnessed these visions for three consecutive nights, and in Islamic theology the visions of prophets constitute revelation, as related inÂ Sahih BukhariÂ (refer to Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani,Â Fath al-BariÂ 6581).\n\n\n[52]Â Most of the objections have the underlying epistemological presumption that the one making the claim about what God has commanded him to do is probably deluded or insane, becauseÂ in realityÂ there is no God telling him to do this or that. However,Â ifÂ it is established with absolute certainty that God has in fact commanded a deed to be performed, a deed which seems to conflict with our ethical sensibilities, what then is the correct course of action? On Ashâarite theology, by Divine command theory, the ethical is defined as whatever God has ordained so this becomes the ethical course of action, while on Hanbalite-Salafist, Maturidite and Muâtazilite theology, fundamental ethical realities are rationally discernible, so Godâs commandments always correspond with what sound reasoning identifies as truly ethical. If something seems otherwise, itâs because we havenât studied it sufficiently. The Quran states that when people attempt to justify immoral actions by stating God commands it, the correct response is to state âVerily, God does not command evilâ (Quran 7:28).\n\n\n[53]Â Quran 21:69.\n\n\n[54]Â Quran 2:260.\n\n\n[55]Â Quran 6:75.\n\n\n[56]Â Quran, 37:102.Â The Quranic exegete, Mahmud al-Alusi (d. 1270 H) notes that this demonstrates the humility of Ishmael in not boldly asserting that he was personally patient, but rather saying that he would be amongst those who are patient if God wills.\n\n\n[57]Â Quran 37:103-105.\n\n\n[58]Â Alastair Hannay.Â Homing in on Fear and Trembling. In: Kierkegaard&#8217;sÂ Fear and Trembling: A Critical Guide. (Cambridge University Press 2015) edited by Daniel Conway. p. 13.\n\n\n[59]Â Al-Shawkani,Â Fath al-Qadir, (Beirut: Dar al-Marefah 2007) p. 1246. There is a classical theological debate between the Muâtazilah and the Ashaaâirah on this issue which Al-Razi (d. 606 H) recounts (Mafatih al-GhaybÂ 37:102). The Muâtazilah hold that Abraham was only commanded by God to perform the steps leading to the sacrifice, not the sacrifice itself, and thus he fulfilled the vision despite never sacrificing Ishmael. Meanwhile the Ashaaâirah contend that the actual sacrifice itself was what he was commanded to perform.\n\n\n[60]Â There is one other element of the New Atheist critique of the story which is logically fallaciousâwhen one is committed to the idea that humans are mere biological animals without special status or sanctity, why is human sacrifice morally objectionable but animal sacrifice is not? If human life is categorically no different from an animal life, what gives humans the right to take the life of an animal for consumption? For Muslims, this right comes only from Divine permission (with the condition that the animal is not killed for sport but that we consume the meat and slaughter the animal in a humane manner), and thus Divine blessing is sought before slaughtering any animal in order for it to beÂ halalÂ (permissible).\n\n\n[61]Â Musnad Ahmad, 2791. ThisÂ hadithÂ was authenticated by Ahmad Shakir while Nasir al-Din al-Albani declared it weak. Some scholars adopting al-Albaniâs view have also opined that since there is no conclusively authentic source to link the practice to Abrahamâs pelting the devil, theÂ JamaratÂ bear no relation to this event. However, they fail to provide an alternative for the origin of the ritual of pelting theÂ Jamarat.\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, findings, and conclusions expressed in these papers and articles are strictly those of the authors.

Even before the 9/11 era began, human rights violations of Muslims consistently made the headlines: death threats against authors like Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, stonings of criminals in the Muslim world, imprisonment of rape victims in Pakistan, sexual assaults on domestic workers in Saudi Arabia, and restrictions on freedom of speech and expression in the Arab world. All of these and more became part of a narrative in which Islam perpetuated a disregard for human life, rights, and freedoms. On the other hand, when placed in opposition to Islam, human rights as we know them today, both the idea and the body of international law, are understood to be agreed upon by the rest of the world in their principle and implementation.Â The conflict between Islam and human rights raises questions for Muslims and non-Muslims alike about the religion and, more specifically, about its compatibility with modern secular rights of the individualâquestions that are closely tied to Islamâs relationship to modernity as a whole.\nIn our current political moment, it is critical to discuss the role of modern secular human rights more broadly and transnationally, especially as it seemsÂ their positionÂ is becoming more and more precarious with the rise of neo-fascist and authoritarian rule. This is true not just under authoritarian rule in parts of the Muslim world, but also in the United States and Europeâhistorically assumed to be proud leaders and bearers of the banner of human rights globally. To understand the challenges to the true protection of human life and freedom is to envision a way forward based on equality and respect.\nFor this reason, the primary aim of this paper is to critique the binary described aboveâthat between Islam and our modern day understanding of âhuman rights.â This critique challenges the mainstream discourse, explores how and why we have arrived at this false dichotomy, and what have been the consequences. It requires a critical study of the history of the modern secular human rights scheme itself, its origins, and its political usage across time and location. The fact that the promotion of human rights has been intertwined with the ongoing process of colonialism is important to understanding the discussion on the relationship between Islam and human rights. As Khaled Abou El Fadl writes,\n\n&#8230;Political realitiesâsuch as colonialism, the persistence of highly invasive and domineering despotic governments, the widespread perception, and reality, of Western hypocrisy in the human rights field, and the emergence and spread of supremacist movements of moral exceptionalism in modern Islamâhave contributed to modes of interpretation and practice that are not consistent with a commitment to human rights&#8230;Colonialism, and its accompanying institution of Orientalism, had not only played a pivotal role in undermining the traditional institutions of Muslim learning and jurisprudence, but it had also posed a serious challenge to traditional Muslim epistemologies of knowledge and sense of moral values. Although international human rights law was enshrined in various treaties during a period in which most Muslim countries had gained political independence, the experiences of colonialism and post-colonialism influenced the Muslim intellectual response in several important respects. Muslims did not first encounter Western conceptions of human rights in the form of the UDHR of 1948, or in the form of negotiated international conventions. Rather, they encountered such conceptions as part of the âWhite Manâs Burdenâ or the âcivilizing missionâ of the colonial era, and as part of the European natural law tradition which was frequently exploited to justify imperialistic policies in the Muslim world.[1]\n\nThe political dimensions of human rights, which will be the focus of this paper, can be understood as the backdrop to the evolution of human rights discourse in Islam and the Muslim world, as well as to human rights discourse on Islam and the Muslim world. In Islamic thought, there has been a politicized view of human rights that has resulted in a discourse that is focused on compatibility and incompatibility. In other words, much of the discussion on human rights in Islam has become either apologeticâharmonizing Islam with modern secular human rightsâor resistantâarguing that Islam inherently goes above and beyond Western human rights.[2]Â \nFinally, this paper provides an introductory overview of the rights tradition in Islam, in an attempt to clarify Islamâs stanceâthrough the Quran, Sunnah, and legal traditionâon human rights.\nThe Problem with the History of Contemporary Human Rights\nWhen we think of human rights today an immediate and relatable association is the international commitment to them in the form of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UDHR, established in 1948, set as its primary goal the advancement and protection of the basic rights of the individual.[3]Â The United Nations itself had been founded just three years earlier in 1945, alongside increasing pressure to include in its Charter an international bill of rights. The global post-war, post-Holocaust context meant that world leaders, especially in the United States and Europe, were concerned with creating an international world order that would place limits on the stateâs power over people, and that would ensure freedoms, respect, and dignity for all people after the horrors of the Nazi regime.[4]Â But the idea of the rights-bearing individual did not, in fact, begin with the UDHR or the United Nations. In other words, the concept of human rights, of the sanctity of life, and the protection of human dignity and freedom, has roots much more vast and widespread than is commonly known or acknowledged. In order to truly understand the complexities of the debate on human rights and Islam, and more generally the critiques of contemporary human rights, we must investigate the roots of the history of the idea. When we do so, we will find these roots are expansive and intersecting andÂ shed light on some of the current issues we face with regards to this topic.\nFirstly, there is a distinction to be made between the concept of human rights, and the body of international human rights law. The idea of human rights comes from an amalgam of religious ideas, natural law, Roman law, Enlightenment values; all of these have influenced our current system of international human rights laws. The early understandings of human rights in the Western world did have strong religious underpinnings. As Thomas Jefferson declared in 1779,\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.[5]Â \n\nShortly thereafter, Alexander Hamilton wrote,\n\nThe sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for amongst old parchments or musty records. They are written, as with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured.[6]Â \n\nBut international human rights law itself, as Paul Sieghart wrote, has gone beyond the ideas from which it originated:\n\n&#8230;[It is] a superior international standard, established by common consent, which caused a disappearance of the need for standards founded on systems of divine law or natural law&#8230;To judge whether a natural law is good or bad, just or unjust, recourse is no longer necessary to the Creator or to Nature or to belief in either of them.[7]\n\nThe period that is most often associated with the development of human rights is the Enlightenment, which began in the 17th century and lasted until the 19thÂ century. Also known as the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment marked the end of the Middle Ages in Europe through the proliferation of scientific innovation, trade, global expansion, the emergence of a middle class, and the disintegration of feudalism. Another major feature of this period is what is now characterized as the beginning of secular, rational thought. While Europe was afflicted by the wars between Catholics and Protestants, a new class of secular thinkers, including notable figures such as Rene Descartes, Emmerich de Vattel, Samuel Pufendorf, and Hugo Grotius began to conceive of the notion of the secular individual, with freedoms and liberties transcending his or her religion. In 1625, Grotius wrote theÂ Rights of War and Peace, in which he delineated that\n\nnatural law derived from God and nature universally endowed all human beings with certain natural rights of protection and just and equal treatment irrespective of any religious or civil status.[8]Â \n\nA few years later in 1628, the English Parliament subsequently passed the Petition of Right, a constitutional document that laid out rights of the subject that the Crown could not transgress. In England during these years, tensions were high between Parliament and the King, because of Parliamentâs refusal to fund the war effort, and King Charlesâ subsequent seizing of funds and arbitrary imprisonment of those who did not comply with his decrees. It was in this context that, in the latter part of the 17thÂ century, the English disseminated the law of habeas corpus, giving prisoners the right to be brought forth before a court of law. All of these developments and others constituted deliberate challenges to the absolute monarchy of the Crown; these challenges culminated in the establishment of the English Bill of Rights in 1689, which included the inalienable rights of representative government, free elections, freedom of speech, religious toleration, trial by jury, and prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. In the 18thÂ century, revolutionary causes in England, America, and France used this rapidly strengthening discourse of human rights to challenge the stateâs authorityâwhether monarchical or colonialâand to call for independence.Â âDignity, liberty, equality, and fraternity,â the famous French revolutionary claim, became a common mantra for various Western struggles of independence.[9]Â Ironically, while the French Revolution produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizenâa charter thought to be one of the founding documents of human rightsâit was at the same time at least partly characterized by the Reign of Terror, a period of extreme violence in which the Revolutionary government brutally punished anyone suspected of not supporting the revolutionary cause. During this time,Â symbolizedÂ byÂ the infamous guillotine, at least 300,000 people were arrested, 17,000 were executed, and 10,000 died in prison awaiting trial.[10]\nThere is, however, more to the history of human rights than its origins in the European Enlightenment:\n\nThe first steps in this direction began with the earliest thoughts and beliefs about the value of human life, what it means to be truly human, and whether people bear any responsibility for the well-being of others. Given these kind of profound, universal, and enduring issues, it is not surprising that some of the first significant philosophies concerning human rights would come from religious tradition. Virtually all of the worldâs greatest religions, despite their many differences, stress the worth and dignity of human life, the common kinship of humankind, and the responsibility that believers have to show compassion, to treat others as they would like to be treated, and to care for those who suffer. These early forms of religious belief may not have created legal or personal rights, but they established traditions and manifested principles that would inform later rights developments.[11]\n\nThe role of non-Christian religions is often erased from the history of human rights, and the movement for human rights has sometimes been presented as a sort of civilizing mission to people of various religions and cultures around the world who must be introduced to the concept. In fact, in contemporary human rights discourse, religion is often designated as an enemy of human rights, as the cause of wars and human rights violations, as a green light for absolute authoritarianism, and as an obstacle to individual freedom.[12]Â As a result, the narrative of rights is largely centered on a Euro-Christian framework when in reality there exist other languages of rights. For example, in Asian cultures (Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, andÂ Confucian), the building blocks of a just and free societyÂ are not the rights of individuals,Â but the obligations individuals have to the society they belong to.[13]Â Although we will explore the tradition of human rights in Islam in depth later in this paper, it is useful here to also turn to examples of other religious and spiritual traditions and briefly summarize their discourses of human rights. This overview can widen the scope of the history of human rights and point to not only the presence of some overarching values in different faith traditions, but also to the breadth of debate within these traditions themselves over what human rights are and how they should be implemented.\nIn his article, âA Jewish Perspective on Human Rights,â Elliot Dorff makes a bold statement:\n\nOne of Judaismâs fundamental theoretical convictions is that God both created the world and owns it. This immediately establishes a ground for moral claims completely different than secular alternatives. The whole drama of life, from the point of view of Judaism, is not played out on the stage of individuals with inherent inalienable rights, it is rather played on the stage of positive and negative duties to God.[14]Â \n\nDorff goes on to explain that, while Judaism gives immense value to each individual as a unique creation, rights and responsibilities are based on a covenant between human beings and God. To give another example, in Buddhism there is extensive debate on whether modern human rights are compatible with the Buddhist tradition or not. Much of pre-modern Buddhist ideas were modeled after the early community of Buddhist monks, one of whose main characteristics was freedom from ego. This, in turn, became the basis for a Buddhist human rights discourse whose foundation was not rights at all, but rather duties. In other words, the Buddhist principles dictate duties of individuals towards other members of their society, duties which ultimately define the rights of others. For example, as James Fredericks writes,\n\nthe [Buddhist] precepts establish the duty of a husband to support his wife, without stating explicitly that the wife has a right to be supported. Howeverâ¦the husbandâs duty establishes the wifeâs right.[15]\n\nCultural Relativism and Universalism\nStemming from and closely related to the question of where the idea of human rights comes fromâa question whose answer, as has been demonstrated by this short history of human rights, is neither succinct nor singular, and requires an acknowledgment of many secular and faith-based traditions in the West and the Eastâis the question of who defines what these human rights are.Â This critique is best illustrated by the debate between what are called the universalist and cultural relativist arguments on human rights. Jack Donnelly, in his seminal article, âCultural Relativism and Universal Human Rights,â describes a spectrum on which these two can be understood. They are defined most clearly at the extremes: on one end of the spectrum, radical cultural relativism is a way of thinking about human rights that prioritizes the legitimacy of cultural norms and beliefs as the only source of authority on defining rights and their limits. Radical universalism, on the other hand, contends that culture is extraneous to the question of rights afforded to people simply by virtue of their being human and that universal notions of morality are what lend validity to the definition of these rights.[16]\nOne obvious problem here concerns authority over moralityâwho decides what is best for a group of people and how they should live their lives? As Donnelly writes,\n\nRadical universalism requires a rigid hierarchical ordering of multiple moral communities to which individuals and groups belong. The radical universalist must give absolute priority to the demands of the cosmopolitan moral community over all other lower communities. This denial of national and subnational ethical autonomy is dubious at best.[17]\n\nIn this way, a radical universalist framework of human rights rejects the agency of communitiesânational, religious, and culturalâto determine and follow their own conceptions of morality, of what it means to be human, and howÂ humansÂ should be treated. Of course, this is deeply problematic because these existential questionsÂ constituteÂ the backbone and purpose of many communities and traditions, including Islam. What is more, this affects the process of human rights promotion and interventions, because both of these are necessarily based on a power dynamic whereby one group of people decides for another the best way to live their lives.\nOn the other hand, it is important to think about and critique the limitations of a cultural relativist argument as well, especially with regards to abuses of human rights. The danger here is that violations of the rights and freedoms of people can be justified by cultural or religious arguments. Donnelly argues,\n\nFor example, chattel slavery and caste systems, which implicitly deny the existence of a morally significant common humanity, are almost universally condemned, even in the most rigid class societies. Likewise, basic moral distinctions between insiders and outsiders have been seriously eroded by individual mobility and by an at least aspirational commitment to the idea of a universal moral community. Relativism rests on the notions of moral autonomy and communal self-determination. To rely on internal judgments entirely would be to abrogate oneâs moral responsibility as a member of the cosmopolitan moral community.[18]\n\nWe can take here as a relevant case study the debate over Muslim women and their various forms of covering to shed light on two important aspects of this discussion: first, the tension between relativism and universalism when evaluating human rights, and second, the way these tensions play out in specific political, cultural, and historical complexities in the case of Islam and the Muslim world today. Especially in the years immediately following the attacks of 9/11, with the advent of the Bush administrationâs War on Terror and US military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan, the rights of Muslim women were a hot topic in US media, political, activist, feminist, and academic discourses. The war effort became in the eyes of many Americans tied to the liberation of Muslim women who were being oppressed in various waysâone of which was the forced covering of their hair and their bodies. This rhetoric fit neatly as a part of the larger case against Islam being employed by the administration, which can best and most concisely be conveyed by George W. Bushâs post 9/11 speech in which he said about Muslims worldwide: âThey hate us for our freedoms.â[19]Â The lack of freedoms and basic human rights afforded to Muslim women by a patriarchal and oppressive Islamic regime was just one example, albeit an exceptionally effective one, that justified support for US military force in Muslim lands, and fueled the feeling that this war was, in fact, a liberating and civilizing mission.\nOn this topic, Lila Abu-Lughod wrote in 2007 the important article, âDo Muslim Women Really Need Saving? Anthropological Reflections on Cultural Relativism and Its Others.â In it, she analyzes the intersection of the Western liberal feminist movement for womenâs rights and the War on Terror and its early 2000s rhetoric, specifically as it was employed by Western women leaders. She writes,\n\nLaura Bushâs radio address on November 17â¦collapsed important distinctions that should have been maintained. There was a constant slippage between the Taliban and the terrorists so that they became almost one wordâa kind of hyphenated monster identity: The Taliban-and-the-terrorists. Then there was the blurring of the very separate causes in Afghanistan of womenâs continuing malnutrition, poverty, and ill health, and their more recent exclusion under the Taliban from employment, schooling, and the joys of wearing nail polish. On the other hand, her speech reinforced chasmic divides, primarily between âthe civilized people throughout the worldâ whose hearts break for the women and children of Afghanistan and the Taliban-and-the-terrorists, the cultural monsters who want to, as she put it, âimpose their world on the rest of us.â Most revealingly, the speech enlisted women to justify American bombing and intervention in Afghanistan and to make a case for the War on Terrorism of which it was allegedly a part. As Laura Bush said, âBecause of our recent military gains in much of Afghanistan, women are no longer imprisoned in their homes. They can listen to music and teach their daughters without fear of punishmentâ¦[20]\n\nBut Abu-Lughodâs critique goes beyond the way that Muslim women are used as a tool in the binary between âusâ and âthem,â the âWestâ and the âother.â She also rightly identifies the problem of culture in the human rights agenda:\n\nThe question is why knowing the âcultureâ of the region, and particularly, its religious beliefs and treatment of women, was more urgent than exploring the history of the development of repressive regimes in the region and the US role in this history. Such cultural framing prevents the serious exploration of roots and nature of human suffering in this part of the world.[21]Â \n\nIn other words, whereas the debate between cultural relativist and universalist arguments about human rights define cultureâincluding religionâas a set of rigid, unchanging, and deterministic value systems and beliefs, Abu-Lughod draws attention to the global interconnectedness between cultures, and the role history and politics have had in shaping them and their shortcomings in the area of human rights.\nFinally, Abu-Lughodâs other primary argument is about the acceptance of differenceâin this case, when it comes to Islam and Muslim womenâand what it means for the endgame of the human rights agenda. She writes,\n\nCan we only free Afghan women to be like us or might we have to recognize that even after âliberationâ from the Taliban they might want different things than we might want for them? Again, when I talk about accepting difference, I am not implying that we should resign ourselves to being cultural relativists who respect whatever goes on elsewhere as âjust their culture.â I have already discussed the dangers of cultural expectations; their cultures are just as much a part of history and an interconnected world as ours are. We may want justice for women, but can we accept that there might be different ideas about justice that different women might want or choose, different features from what we envision as best?Â We must consider that they might be called to personhood in a different language.[22]\n\nViolence and oppression in the name of human rights\nTo what extent is the discourse of âhuman rightsâ selectively applied by forces in power? To what extent is the banner of human rights raised to justify campaigns that brutalize the âotherâ in order to secure and maintain the political interests of the elite?\nA critique of the contemporary human rights agenda that is certainly relevant to Islam and the Muslim world is related to the notion of security, especially in the last two decades. The attacks of 9/11 triggered a forceful agenda surrounding international security, led by the US and which included an increase in American military interventions abroad and a tightening of national security measures domestically. The subject of security raises a controversial debate over the tension between security and the protection of rights, whether political, social, civil, or otherwise, both at home and abroad. The effects of the newly emboldened security paradigm put in place in the early 2000s are still apparent, both domestically and internationally, and are closely related to the issues of Islamophobia that fuel the âclash of civilizationsâ[23]Â rhetoric related to Islam and human rights. Above all, the debates on security raise the questions of whose human rights are included in, or worth, international indignation and protection, and for what purposes is the sacrifice of these rights deemed justifiable.\nThe justification of torture\nThe past US Presidential election campaign saw a contentious debate on the use of torture, with then Republican candidate Donald Trump advocating for the use of torture all the way through to his victory, declaring in his first presidential interview, â[Torture] absolutely worksâ¦we have to fight fire with fireâ[24]Â and promoting a re-opening of CIA black site prisons, secret facilities around the world that were used to detain suspects in George W. Bushâs War on Terrorâmuch to the displeasure of not only Democrats and human rights activists, but evenÂ manyÂ in his own party. On one side of the debate, torture is a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsâ Article 5, âno one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.â[25]Â The argument for torture, then, is rooted primarily in its characterization as a necessary evil used for the security and protection of the country, its citizens, and its interests. Rhetoric aside, in reality we need to look no further than the incidents at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay to know that torture is a tactic alive and well. Nonetheless, the debate on torture is illustrative of the dynamic between human rights and security, and the tendency of the latter to trumpâfor lack of a better wordâthe former.\nAlan Dershowitz, a legal scholarÂ atÂ HarvardÂ University until his retirement, argued for a prioritizing of security in his article, âTortured Reasoning,âÂ publishedÂ in 2004. Claiming that heÂ wasÂ against torture âas a normative matter,â Dershowitz argued that it is sometimes necessary in the case of a âticking bomb terrorist case.â[26]Â The ticking time bomb symbol has become prevalent in discussions on torture and terrorism, even disseminated in popular culture on television and in moviesâthe pressure of time, the threat of a terrorist attack, and the certain guilt of the suspect combined create circumstances in which torture is seen as a necessary and justifiable tool.[27]\nThe erosion of civil liberties\nAnother example ofÂ theÂ rights of certain groups being undercut in the name of security that is perhaps closer to home, is theÂ recentÂ civil rights struggles ofÂ certainÂ minorities in the United States, namely immigrants and Muslim Americans. The Patriot Act, passed after September 11, was intended to combat terrorism, and raised many questions and concerns about violations of the rights of Americans, including their right to privacy. David Cole wrote in his critical piece on the Patriot Act in 2003, âLetâs Fight Terrorism, Not the Constitution,â\n\nâ¦The USA Patriot Actâ¦violates core constitutional principles, rendering immigrants deportable for their political associations, excludable for pure speech, and detainable on the attorney generalâs say-so. And by reserving its harshest measures for immigrantsâin the immediately foreseeable future, Arab and Muslim immigrantsâit sacrifices commitments to equality by trading a minority groupâs liberty for the majorityâs security.[28]Â \n\nSince then concern for the civil liberties of Arabs and Muslims in America has only increased, as measures to counter violent extremism domestically have expanded to use strategies like undercover surveillance and entrapment in Muslim American communities.[29]Â \nThese contemporary and domestic examples of theÂ inconsistencies of human rightsÂ are not unrelated to the historically rooted problem of the West and those it conceives of asÂ âothersââwhether within the borders of the nation-state or beyond. Chandra Muzaffar writes,\n\nBut what is sad is that while Europe built the edifice of the individual within its own borders, it destroyed the human person on other shores. As human rights expanded among white people, European empires inflicted horrendous human wrongs upon the colored inhabitants of the planet. The elimination of the native populations of the Americas and Australasia and the enslavement of millions of Africans during the European slave trade were two of the greatest human rights tragedies of the colonial epochâ¦. Though formal colonial rule has ended, Western domination and control continues to impact upon the human rights of the vast majority of the people of the non-Western world in ways which are more subtle and sophisticated but no less destructive and devastating.[30]\n\nWith regards to Islam, from the beginnings of colonialism, the relationship between colonizing powers and the Muslim world included a discourse on human rights that was unequal in its power distribution. In his bookÂ Islam in Liberalism,Â Joseph MassadÂ extends this point to make the argument that Islam became the necessary âotherâ Western colonial powers needed to define themselves and justify their imperial expansion. He quotes Paul Kahn, who describes an American attitude of exceptionalism regarding liberal principles including human rights:\n\nOur contemporary missionaries preach democracy, free markets, and the rule of lawâall institutions founded on our belief in the equality and liberty of every person. This dogged commitment to a universal community is a part of our Christian and Enlightenment traditions. We experience this simultaneously as a kind of open-ended love and as a faith in the capacity of each individual to enter into a rational debate that will result in mutual agreement. No one, we believe, is beyond conversion to our values. When we dream of a global world order, we project our own values onto it. We do not imagine that the global community of the future will be led by an Islamic cleric.[31]\n\nThisÂ serves as an introduction to the problem of human rights and Islam in a transnational and colonial senseâa problem that we continue to see play out in Western foreign policy and military engagement in the Muslim world. Historically, the argumentÂ used in the mainstream discourseÂ for the spread and protection of liberal valuesâincluding human rightsâfor all people has been instrumental in justifyingÂ wars, occupation, torture, against groups of those people.\nÂ \nHuman Rights in Islam\nFinally, we turn toÂ a descriptionÂ of what the Islamic position on rights actually is. Although the question of compatibility requires a proper critiqueâwhy do we perceive such an incompatibility between Islam and human rights and what are the inconsistencies in our understanding of human rights in the first place?âit is at the same time important to note Islamâs care and concern for the dignity and freedoms of the individual and for a just and tolerant society. Today, some of the biggest controversies over Islam and human rights come from questions that have been written about in depth by scholars at the Roadsider Institute for Islamic Research, especially concerningÂ apostasy,Â the rights of women, and theÂ rights of people of other faiths.Â In this section, I will not cover the details of these debates; rather, I will address the broader themes that influence how we can think about human rights in Islam. This section is by no means a comprehensive exposition of an Islamic human rights theory, but instead, its purpose is to simply show that Islam and the concept of human rights are not at odds.\nIn his article, âThe Dilemma of Islamic Rights Schemes,â Ebrahim Moosa argues that a moral approach towards humankind is, in fact, the foundation of the Islamic calling:\n\nFrom its very inception in the seventh century Arabia, the message of Islam demonstrated a preoccupation with the social, moral, and spiritual condition of human beings. The deity proclaimed by the Prophet Muhammad to the world was both the âLord of the Worldsâ and âLord of the People.â The subject of the prophetâs revelation, the Quran, was not exclusively a self-revelation of God to humanity, but an instant where humanity became the very leitmotif ofÂ revelation.[32]Â \n\nHe goes on to give the example of the Prophet Muhammad ï·ºâs methods of governance in Medina, citing theÂ CompactÂ of Medina as an agreement between the various faith communities in the city, by the standards of which all signatories agreed to certain rights and responsibilities. The Prophet ï·ºâs example extended to the coming generations of Muslims and Muslim expansion,Â who protected the rights of their subjects regardless of faith.[33]\nKhaled Abou El Fadl characterizes this as the core value of justice in Islam. In that sense, the role of the state, he argues, is to uphold justice in society by protecting its subjects. Abou El Fadl quotes Ibn al Qayyim, who states:\n\nGod sent His message and His books to lead people with justiceâ¦Therefore, if a just leadership is established, through any means, then therein is the Way of Godâ¦In fact, the purpose of Godâs Way is the establishment of righteousness and justiceâ¦so any road that establishes what is right and just is the road [Muslims] should follow.[34]\n\nAtÂ an early point in Islamic jurisprudence, Muslim scholars and jurists identified three categories of rights: the rights of God, the rights of persons, and dual rights.Â Moosa describes the rights of GodÂ as:Â \n\nthose rights and duties that have a revealed imperative and a religious rationale. They can be both mandatory obligations of a devotional kind such as ritual obligations or they could involve acts that benefit the entireÂ community.[35]Â \n\nHe includes in this category acts such as observing the five pillars of IslamÂ and providingÂ services that result in the protection of the community from harm and the promotion of good in society. The next category, and perhaps the one most relevant to the topic at hand, is that of the rights of persons. These rights deal with âindividual and social interests,â and address the worldly concerns and affairs of people, including secular and civil issues like the right to health, to family, to safety, and to property. Finally, the category of dual rights is the site of overlap between the the rights of God and the rights of people.[36]\nIn the broadest sense, there clearly exists in Islam the concept of the human being as an autonomous entity. First and foremost, Allah (swt) says in the Quran,Â âWe have indeed honored the Children of Adamâ;[37]Â that is, God hasÂ given dignity to human beings. This dignity is irrespective of religion, race, gender, socioeconomic statusâin short, it is inalienable and universal. One story that demonstrates this inherent respect for the God-given dignity of the human being occurred during the time of the caliphate of Umar (ra). The son of Amr ibn Al âAs, one of the governors of the caliphate,Â harshly beratedÂ a Coptic man during a game of sports and did not face any consequence. Umar (ra) wrote to Amr ibn al âAs and asked him, âSince when have you enslaved a people, O Amr, when their mothers have given birth to them in freedom?â In some narrations, Umar (ra) authorized the Copt to retaliate in kind to Amr ibn al âAs himself, rather than to his son.[38]Â The lessons that can be drawn from this incident are multiple: first, there is a clear acknowledgment of theÂ freedom of the individual, regardless of his or her transgressions, which are in this story irrelevant. The conditions for his freedom were simply that he was born a free man, and this in itself afforded him the right to be treated withÂ respect and dignity. What is more, once these rights were transgressed upon, the figure of authority was held accountable, pointing to the limitations on Muslim ruling powers when it came to the rights of individuals. Â \nAs in other faith traditions, the sanctity of life is a vital principle in Islam. At multiple points in the Quran, Allah (swt) prohibits the taking of life:\n\nFor this reason, We prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soulâunless it be for another soul or working corruption upon the earthâit is as though he slew mankind altogether, and whosoever saves the life of one, it is as though he saved the life of mankind altogether. Our messengers have certainly come unto them with clear proofs. Yet even after that, many of them are prodigal on the earth. Â (The Quran, 5:32)[39]\nAnd slay not the soul that God has made inviolable, save by right. And whosoever is slain unjustly, We have appointed authority unto his heir. Then let him not be excessive in slaying. Verily, he shall be helped.Â (The Quran, 17:33)[40]\nSay, Come, I will recite that which your Lord has forbidden you: that you ascribe nothing as partner unto Him, and that you be virtuous toward parents, and that you slay not your children for fear of povertyâWe will provide for you and for themâand approach not indecencies, whether outward or inward, and slay not the soul that God has made inviolable, save by right. This He has enjoined upon you, that haply you may understand.Â (The Quran,Â 6:151)[41]\n\nAllah (swt) commands not only thatÂ each personÂ hasÂ the right to life, but also to its enjoyment:\n\nO Children of Adam! Put on your adornment at every place of worship, and eat and drink, but be not prodigal. Truly He loves not the prodigal. Say, Who has forbidden the adornment of God, which He has brought forth for his servants, and the good things among His provision? Say, These are for those who believe, in the life of this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they are for them alone. Thus do We expound the signs for a people who know. Say, My Lord has only forbidden indecenciesâboth outward and inwardâand sin, and tyranny without right, and that you should ascribe partners unto God, for which He has sent down no authority, and that you should say of God that which you know not.Â (The Quran, 7:31-33)[42]\n\nBeyond the broader values of the sanctity of life and respect for human dignity, Islam does clearly decree more specific basic and inalienable rights for all people. Both through the example of the ProphetÂ ï·ºÂ and from directives given in the Quran, Islamic tradition valuesÂ equality for people in terms of their civil, social, and political well-being. On the right to shelter and food, it is narrated by Uthman (ra) that the ProphetÂ ï·ºÂ said:\n\nThere is no right for the son of Adam in other than these things: A house which he lives in, a garment which covers his nakedness, and a piece of bread, andÂ water.[43]Â \n\nWhat is more, however, is that Islamic tradition goes beyond advocating for equal access to life and sustenance; it places responsibility on people to ensure these rights for others:\n\nAnd in whose wealth is acknowledged due for the beggar and the deprived.Â (The Quran 70:24-25)[44]Â \n\nAmong the other rights afforded to individuals simply by virtue of their being human are the right toÂ freedom of belief, the right to knowledge, and the right to differ.Â \nOn freedom of belief:Â \nThere is no coercion in religion. Sound judgment has become clear from error.Â (The Quran 2:256)[45]Â \nOn the right to knowledge:Â \nWhosoever is rightly guided is only rightly guided for the sake of his own soul, and whosoever is astray is only astray to its detriment. None shall bear the burden of another. And never do We punish till We have sent a messenger.Â (The Quran 17:15).[46]Â \nOn the right to differ:Â \nAnd We have sent down unto thee the Book in truth, confirming the Book that came before it, and as a protector over it. So judge between them in accordance with what God has sent down, and follow not their caprices away from the truth that has come unto thee. For each among you We have appointed a law and a way. And had God willed, He would have made you one community, but He willed otherwise, that He might try you in that which He has given you. So vie with one another in good deeds. Unto God shall be your return all together, and He will inform you of that wherein you differ.Â (The Quran 5:48)[47]Â \nConclusion\nIn 1990, a set of Muslim states came together toÂ ratifyÂ the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam. The states had previously criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 for not taking into account cultural and religious frameworks of human rights in non-western contexts. As a result, these states wrote a Declaration that largely reinforced the universalist assertions made in the UDHR itself, but used the language of Islam to convey and justify its tenets.ThisÂ exampleÂ raises the question: is there, or does there need to be, a separate Islamic framework of human rights? And is it necessarily different from,Â or at odds with,Â theÂ modern secular framework ofÂ human rights? Clearly, the signatories of the Cairo Declaration felt the need to assert an Islamic version of, or at least affirm an Islamic compatibility with, the set of human rights deemed to be morally acceptable and protectableÂ by the United Nations.\nIn reality, the question of whether Islam and modern human rights are compatible is important because, in order toÂ addressÂ it, we must look at the roles of not just religion, but of history, of power, and of morality itself. This intersection sheds light on the problems with our current understanding of human rights and how they are protected. As this paper has shown, modern human rights are rife with contradictions, contradictions that are very acutely connected with the manipulation of Islam for political ends. On the one hand, Islamic texts and history show a deep concern for the sanctity and enjoyment of life, and for individual freedoms in every sense: from respect for the individual on an interpersonal level to the protection of the individual from corrupted authority, religious or otherwise. On the other, Islam is at the center of many agendas concerning resources, military expansion, security, and culture, and this fact has been instrumental in creatingÂ a problem of Islam and human rightsÂ that has little to do with the religion itself.\n\n\n\n[1]Â Abou El Fadl, Khaled. âThe Human Rights Commitment in Islam,â in In Joseph Runzo, Nancy M.
